99% of people in the modern western world are completely apathetic regarding Jehovah's Witnesses and their message. They just don't care. But if you have a question, to them it reveals that you do care. And therefore they generally love it when people ask them questions. They might not be so happy if you were to ask them one of these. 

Though Harrison Cother is no longer Jehovah's Witnesses, there exists a widespread perception that Jehovah's Witnesses have an answer for just about everything. 

But they don't. The two most important words when discussing this topic are <b>mental programming</b>. Jehovah's Witnesses are only conscious and capable of answering questions that fall within the regulated guidelines and confines of their mental programming. 

While the organization tries to spin this narrative that every single individual who leaves the religion are proud, dishonest and sinful. The reality is that there are vast numbers droves of people that are leaving the religion because they've come to the realization that it is not the truth that it claims to be, that there are numerous, serious, significant questions to which the answers destroy the organization's doctrine and practices. 

And so the fact that Jehovah's Witnesses desire you to ask them questions, and they in turn desire to share the truth with you, combined with the fact that there are these questions that go outside the confines of their mental programming, results in a potential gateway to send their minds into overdrive, to lead them to hopefully questioning their beliefs with intellectual honesty. That might sound like a fairy tale because if you've ever attempted to do that, you will understand just how difficult it is. And so before we delve into these questions, I need to provide a few essential caveats: 

<b>First</b>, don't expect to be a catalyst for change. These questions have the capacity to plant a seed of doubt in someone's mind. But there is no guarantee that they will be intellectually honest, that they will be unbiased and open minded and actually address and investigate the answers. I was in a year long email interchange with my dad in which I posed many of the questions from this list and they had zero impact. There is a saying you cannot reason someone out of something that they were not reasoned into. 

<b>The second caveat</b>, these questions are absolutely useless unless you have the right approach and demeanor. You may have heard the expression it's not what you said, it was how you said it. Now, if that is true with regards to talking with an everyday-regular-never-been-an-cult person, then when talking to a Jehovah's Witness, times that by 10,000. Because if you're asking one of these questions, it reveals to them that you know something. You know something about their organization's history, practices and doctrine. Why are you asking that question? Do you really want to know the truth? Or are you just a proud, mentally diseased, fire breathing apostate? 

<b>Caveat number three</b>. there is nothing wrong with saying I don't know. Some of the world's greatest minds have to acknowledge and hold their hands up and say, we don't know, in response to certain questions. But human ignorance is different from willful ignorance and the denial of evidence and rational thinking. The answers to these questions are not obscure and unknowable. They are clear and obvious. 

And <b>the fourth and final caveat</b> is that while the title is Five Questions Jehovah's Witnesses Cannot Answer, they will most likely offer an answer, but it will not be sufficient or satisfying. It will be one of their generic conversation stoppers, such as anything is possible with Jehovah. Jehovah must have had a reason. Look, we're going to have to leave this in Jehovah's hands. These self soothing and cathartic oneliners are extremely beneficial to Jehovah's Witnesses. 

Not only do they end the conversation, but it keeps their cherished, beloved faith and belief system intact. The reason I say it's not sufficient or satisfying as an answer and why I'm not technically classing a response such as that as an actual answer is because it's like asking a toddler how to spell Encyclopedia, Britannica or what pie is to nine decimal places. Sure, they may try their best, or they might just scream in your face and run off. Either way, that answer is derived from an inability to offer a sufficient and satisfying answer. 

<h1>Question #5: Is there sufficient reason to believe that current Jehovah's Witness doctrine is true and will not be disposed of?</h1> 

Yes. Okay. Over the years there have been minor changes and adjustments in certain understandings, but that is to be expected. Jehovah said that the path of the righteous would get brighter and brighter. 

In fact, we look forward to Jehovah revealing new light in due time. Very recently, in fact, Sam Heard, Governing Body member discussed at the 2021 annual meeting new light with regards to an adjustment in our understanding regarding the anointed, the specifics of that doctrinal change are completely irrelevant. What is vital, however, is who is credited with providing that doctrinal change? Who is the source of this new light? 

<div class = "quote">
And what I'm about to reveal to you today, jehovah is behind it, not the governing body, not any human here on the earth, but Jehovah God.
</div>

Malachi 3:6 informs us that God does not change. Titus 1:2 says that God cannot lie. In theory, therefore, we should be able to take any organizational teaching or understanding in the religion's history and ask the question: is it possible for a God who does not change and cannot lie to really be behind it? 

For example, if you were to go on JW Facts under the heading Changes to the Generation Teaching, you will see that there have been six different contradictory understandings of the term generation as allegedly used by Jesus in Matthew 24. 

This table shows that over the years the start date has changed, changed 1 AD, and 1 AD again. The potential end date has changed, changed, and changed. The length has changed approximately five times, and who the term applies to has changed 1 AD and 1 AD again. 

I'm only going to say this once. Charles Tayes Russell, the religion's credited founder, had it right all along when he said:

<div class = "quote">
A new view of truth never can contradict a former truth. "New light" never extinguishes older "light," but adds to it. 
</div>

Pyramidology, extinguished. Armageddon arriving in 1914, 15, 18, extinguished. Beth sarim, extinguished. Don't have kids because it's 1938 and Armageddon is imminent, extinguished. Millions now living will never die, extinguished. The worship of Jesus, extinguished. We could go on and on and on. The truth is that this policy, this teaching of new light coming from Jehovah, was disproved and destroyed before any Jehovah's Witness alive today was born. 

A conversation on this topic could follow a very simple format. You could ask a Jehovah's Witness. Can Jehovah lie? No. Even just for a short time before he provides truth? No. So is it possible that Jehovah was really behind past truth? 

These past teachings which have now been disposed of? No. So then why should we trust any of the current teachings or doctrine? Because JW.org is now available in over 1000 languages. So God you know. 

Speaking of people being deceived and misled brings us nicely to question number four. 

<h1>Question #4: Is it true that Jehovah's Witnesses predicted that Armageddon would arrive in 1975?</h1>

In the Genesis creation account there are seven days. 6000 years of human history will be ending in 1975. The Bible speaks about Jesus having a thousand year reign. And remember the verse, a day to Jehovah is as a thousand years and a thousand years is as a day. You throw all of those ingredients into the mixing bowl of a boardroom in America of severely deluded elderly men and what do you get? Millions of people misled but substantial organizational growth. How appropriate it would be for Jehovah God to make of this coming 7th period of a thousand years a Sabbath period of rest and release. 

It would not be by mere chance or accident but would be according to the loving purpose of Jehovah God for the reign of Jesus Christ, the Lord of the Sabbath to run parallel with the 7th millennium of man's existence. 

<div class = "quote">
Well, now, as Jehovah's Witnesses, as runners. even though some of us have become a little weary. It almost seems as though Jehovah has provided meat and due season because he's held up before all of us a new goal, a new year. 

Something to reach out for. And it just seems it's given all of us so much more energy and power in this final burst of speed for the finish line. And that's the year 1975, as one brother put it, stay alive to 75. 
</div>

That is only the tip of the iceberg with regards to the level of emphasis that this organization put on the 1970s as a decade of global change, the decade in which this wicked world would meet its end. 

And yet, astonishingly, I wasn't aware of any of what you just heard or saw. I was completely in the dark. And I believe my dad was as well, because if I was asked on the ministry a few years ago as a Jehovah's Witness, this exact question, did your organization predict Armageddon would arrive in 1975? 

I would have merely echoed what my dad told me regarding that year, which was likely what his parents told him regarding that year. Well, the organization never actually predicted that Armageddon was going to come in 1975. It was all merely speculation, and some people just got carried away with the wrong idea. Although I would have said that there would have existed a degree of cognitive dissonance because I was aware of some aged, mature, very spiritual brothers and sisters in the congregation who, in the build up to 1975, sold their homes in order to devote more time and resources to the preaching and teaching work. 

Did these brothers and sisters get carried away with the wrong idea? Or did the leaders of the organization. Get carried away with the wrong idea. Reports are heard of brothers selling their homes and property and planning to finish out the rest of their days in this old system in the pioneer service. 

Certainly this is a fine way to spend the short time remaining before the wicked world's end. Clearly, there is sufficient evidence to categorically say that organization taught that the world was coming to an end in the 1970s, in particular 1975. 

When you look at the organization's growth during the late sixties and early seventies, the cynic among you will likely say this was a crafty underhanded tactic to gain more members. Now, while I'm not saying that I adopt that view, I certainly think it's a question that can be asked. Once the witness is fully aware of the scale of the undue and erroneous emphasis that was placed on the 70s, in particular in 1975, you could ask them a question such as, do you think the leaders of your organization were honestly mistaken? Or do you think this was a dishonest deploy to gain more followers? 

<h1>Question #3: If true Christians should avoid all pagan practices, why do Jehovah's Witnesses adopt practices such as excommunication, shunning and wedding rings?</h1> 

<div class = "quote">
Do origins really matter? Yes. To illustrate: Suppose you saw a piece of candy lying in the gutter. Would you pick up that candy and eat it? Of course not. That candy is unclean. Like that candy, holidays may seem sweet, but they have been picked up from unclean places.
</div>

After studying that paragraph with non Jehovah's Witnesses for many years. I'm sure you can imagine my shock, horror, my astonishment when I first read the January 8, 1947 Awake article, "Are you also excommunicated?" 

In that article, Jehovah's organization labels this Catholic practice of excommunication, <u class = "red">"canon law", which the Roman Catholic hierarchy seeks to enforce on the pretext that it is God's law</u>. They say that <u class = "red">it is altogether foreign to Bible teachings</u>. that <u class = "red">excommunication is not without pagan influence</u>. It's derived from <u class = "red">Superstitious Greeks and druids</u>. And perhaps most significantly, they label this practice as <u class = "red">a weapon, which became the instrument by which the clergy attained a combination of ecclesiastical power and secular tyranny that finds no parallel in history</u>. 

Perhaps in hindsight, what is even more incredible and laughable is the fact that only five years after writing this article, the organization introduced excommunication as a measure of discipline and punishment. Under the label that it was a loving act of God known as disfellowshipping. 

Now, you would think that surely if there was any article in the world that could cause a Jehovah's Witness to stop in their tracks and reassess their beliefs, it would be one that is produced by their own organization which slates a practice as pagan, as non biblical, as used by leaders to attain power that they have adopted themselves. 

But unfortunately, that was not the case with me and my dad, for when I sent him this article, this was his response. 

<div class = "quote">
The points in the article you refer to on Excommunication are completely taken out of context. It is an article discussing the <b><i><u>Catholic Church's</u> use of excommunication as a weapon</b></i> not our use of it. 
See here: https://www.jw.org/en/library/magazines/w20150415/disfellowshipping-a-loving-provision. It is based on Jehovah's direction in the Bible from 2000 years ago. </div>

You know what? Maybe my dad has a point. Maybe I am speaking out of ignorance. Maybe I've just looked at an Apostate website and forward it to him without realizing that I was spreading misinformation and half truths. 

Maybe the Catholic Church's use of Excommunication was and is completely different to the loving disfellowshipping used by Jehovah's organization. So let's have a look at what Wikipedia says about Catholic Excommunication. See if it's similar to Jehovah's Witnesses Disfellowshipping and shunning. 

<div class = "quote">
The Catholic Church claims that the penalty of Excommunication is biblical, tick.  
that it can affect only those who by baptism have been admitted to that society, tick.  
that those under excommunication were to be shunned, tick.  
that they are to be considered as an exile from Catholic society and as non-existent, tick. 
and it is intended to invite the person to change behavior or attitude, repent and return to full communion, tick. 
</div>

That is five out of five that the Catholic Church and Jehovah's Witnesses have in common regarding their usage of excommunication and shunning as tools of discipline and apparently love to get someone to return to the Church. 

Although I think this article is, Perfect. You couldn't have wished for a better article to help wake a Jehovah's Witness up from their indoctrination. The interchange with my dad just goes to show that even if you, as a beloved family member, have the best will and intentions in the world, you cannot get them to think. As the saying goes, you can lead a horse to water, but you can't make them drink. Or what I dubbed the Jehovah's Witness version, you can lead a Jehovah's Witness to water, but you can't make them think. 

Question number two is based on the life experience of a good friend of mine, Lacey Jones, who recorded her story on the Lloyd Evans Channel just over a year ago under the title "My Elders Delayed a Police Investigation!" The question is, 

<h1>Question #2: if Jehovah is behind the organization, why doesn't he remove appointed men who have sexually abused children? Why does he keep some of them in their positions for years, even decades, after the abuse occurs?</h1> 

When I first encountered Lacey's story, I was shocked at so many different parts of it. But perhaps the most pertinent part with regards to my own viewpoints and spiritual skepticism, was the fact that between the abuse happening by an elder and it coming to light, there was a ten year gap. 

A ten year gap wherein this elder was doing home in a way public talks, saying prayers in behalf of small groups of brothers and sisters and also the congregation. He did shepherding visits on families with small children, and perhaps worst of all, he was a part of judicial committees which would judge sinners and potentially exclude them from the congregation for their atrocities, when in reality, he was guilty of what many people would consider to be the worst crime against humanity possible. Now, why does this example have the capacity, the potential, to be so devastating to a Jehovah's Witness? 

They believe that it is Jehovah who is responsible, ultimately, for appointing brothers and for removing them. And yet, when you look at an example such as this, jehovah is nowhere to be seen. Not only did he not prevent the abuse from taking place in the first place, but he did not immediately remove this brother from his position and from the organization entirely. 

For ten years, he just sat back and did nothing. As this brother paraded about with this elevated sense of self importance, thinking that he's gotten away with murder, it was Lacey who took action, not Jehovah. She took the matter to the Elders and to the police, because Jehovah was never going to. The unfortunate reality that abuse survivors who leave the religion have to deal with unbelievably is that quite often their stories are dismissed, not taken seriously, or just ignored by those on the inside. 

If you mention this to a believer, they might just pretend that the issue doesn't exist and stick their head in the sand. They have once again been trained and brainwashed to believe that any news outlet or media source that isn't JW.org and his beloved organization is potentially contaminated by the devil and spreading misinformation and lies about his chosen people. 

But on the other side of the coin, this is a topic which has, as I said, the potential to change lives and wake people up. It was through sharing this story and asking this question with a Jehovah's Witness that I used to know that the individual eventually woke up and faded from the religion. 

They came to the conclusion that it was impossible that Jehovah was behind the organization. But I want to escalate this one step further because it's one thing to say that Jehovah isn't behind this specific organization but it's another thing to say that Jehovah this God that I've believed in my entire life doesn't exist whatsoever. 

<h1>Question #1: Why did Jehovah create a global ecosystem of fear, pain and death?</h1>

<div class = "quote">
Excuse me? He didn't. That question is derived from an ignorance of what the Bible really teaches. You see, in Genesis, God created a paradise, a unified utopia for which man, along with animal, would dwell in peace and security. But we know what happened next. Satan's, rebellion, original sin. And as 1 John 5:19 says "although we originate with God, the whole world is lying in the power of the wicked one."   
In scripture, Jehovah has promised that once again in future the earth will be restored to its paradise like conditions and animals will be reverted to their original behavior and temperament. 
</div>

The last 6000 years of history fall well within the confines of Jehovah's Witness mental programming. That is a classic example of the sort of programmed response you will receive when you ask this question. 

But the doubt that I had since being a child was before 6000 years ago. When we look back in time, we find thousands of fossils of species belonging to various genuses and families where if these animals were designed, they were exquisitely designed to be ruthless killing machines. 

Over the years, when I'd raised this question to my dad, to other elders and even to various circuit overseers I would always receive the same responses.

<div class = "quote">
well, we don't know because the Bible is silent on the topic. However, we do know Jehovah and we know that he only acts out of love. Look, scientists are often wrong. Only recently, some scientists came out and said that they think the t-rex was actually a scavenger. So all those scenes that you see in Jurassic Park could be absolute nonsense. 
</div>

For a long time, those answers had to suffice. But there was a limit to my cognitive dissonance. Eventually, I did online research. I went to museums and I found numerous examples of animals engaging in carnivorous and predatory behavior prior to 4000 BC. No longer would the words "we don't know" be sufficient. I now knew the truth. What if a Jehovah's Witness was to say 

<div class = "quote">
okay, congratulations. You found fossils, but so what? I mean, why does this topic bother you so much? 
</div>

From a young age, I would watch Nature Documentaries with my dad. And whenever a crocodile or a lion or a cheeter took down an antelope or a gazelle, my dad would always say, poor thing, Satan's system. And that was the explanation. These animals weren't created to be like this. Don't be so silly. It is Satan's wicked influence on this planet. And I knew that Jehovah just couldn't wait to bring about paradise and to reverse the atrocities as I perceived them that I was watching on TV.

As I grew up, I got a mobile phone and as you do, you scroll the internet, you watch various videos. And I came across horrific scenes in the natural world of animals such as Gazals being disemboweled and eaten whilst they're alive and they're crying out in pain. And scenes like that scarred my mind and hurt my heart to a great extent. I still can vividly and graphically remember them. 

And so all the time while I was watching those scenes, I would think to myself well, yeah, imagine how Jehovah feels. We were made in his image. He is the loving, caring, merciful, just empathetic God. His heart must be torn too when he sees things like this. But if that evidence is true of fossilized carnivorous behavior before 6000 years ago Satan can no longer be the scapegoat. The buck has to stop with Jehovah. It was Jehovah who for millions upon millions of years created this global ecosystem, this coliseum in space upon which fear, pain, bloodshed and barbaric brutality prevailed. 

And there's no getting around that. When you have this evidence, you are left in a true dichotomy. The evidence is either wrong and Jehovah is right or Jehovah is wrong, and the evidence is right. Although the Elders repeatedly tried to get me to drop this doubt, I came to realize that having doubts was not just a good thing, it was a great thing. 

Doubts are our mind's way of letting us know that something isn't right. There is a problem. And thank goodness, from a young age, I had this doubt because eventually, that's what spurred me to look into other things and to eventually leave the organization. 

So those are my top five questions, which Jehovah's Witnesses cannot answer. If you're a former Jehovah's Witness, I know what you're thinking. Where was Noah's ark? What about the fact that the organization was a registered NGO of the United Nations for around a decade? 

How hypocritical what about the name Jehovah or blood transfusions? Rest assured that whittling down 20, 30, 40 topics into top five questions was the hardest part of this process. But I'm eager to know were any of the five questions that I highlighted in this video key stumbling blocks as to why you couldn't stay in the religion any longer? 

Or are there other questions that I haven't mentioned which led you to realizing that this organization simply isn't the truth? I look forward to reading your comments.
