*Messiah* comes from the Hebrew word *mashiach* and means “anointed one” or “chosen one.” The Greek equivalent is the word *Christos* or, in English, *Christ*. The name “Jesus Christ” is the same as “Jesus the Messiah.” In biblical times, anointing someone with oil was a sign that God was consecrating or setting apart that person for a particular role. Thus, an “anointed one” was someone with a special, God-ordained purpose.

In the Old Testament, people were anointed for the positions of prophet, priest, and king. God told Elijah to anoint Elisha to succeed him as Israel’s prophet ([1 Kings 19:16](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Kings/19/1-Kings-19-16.html)). Aaron was anointed as the first high priest of Israel ([Leviticus 8:12](https://www.bibleref.com/Leviticus/8/Leviticus-8-12.html)). Samuel anointed both Saul and David as kings of Israel ([1 Samuel 10:1](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/10/1-Samuel-10-1.html); [16:13](https://www.bibleref.com/1-Samuel/16/1-Samuel-16-13.html)). All of these men held “anointed” positions. But the Old Testament predicted a coming Deliverer, chosen by God to redeem Israel ([Isaiah 42:1](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/42/Isaiah-42-1.html); [61:1–3](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/61/Isaiah-61-1.html)). This Deliverer the Jews called the Messiah.

Jesus of Nazareth was and is the prophesied Messiah ([Luke 4:17–21](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/4/Luke-4-17.html); [John 4:25–26](https://www.bibleref.com/John/4/John-4-25.html)). Throughout the New Testament, we see proof that Jesus is the Chosen One: “These [miracles] are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Messiah, the Son of God, and that by believing you may have life in his name” ([John 20:31](https://www.bibleref.com/John/20/John-20-31.html)). We also hear testimonies that Jesus is “the Messiah, the Son of the living God” Matthew 16:16 ([Matthew 16:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Matthew/16/Matthew-16-16.html)). The ultimate evidence that Jesus is indeed the promised Messiah, the Anointed One, is His resurrection from the dead. [Acts 10:39–43](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/10/Acts-10-39.html) is an eyewitness testimony to His resurrection and the fact that “he is the one whom God appointed as judge of the living and the dead.”

<b>Jesus fulfills the role of Prophet, Priest, and King</b>, which is further evidence to His being the Messiah. He is a prophet, because He embodied and preached the Word of God (see [John 1:1–18](https://www.bibleref.com/John/1/John-1-1.html); [14:24](https://www.bibleref.com/John/14/John-14-24.html); and [Luke 24:19](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-19.html)); a priest, because His death atones for our sins and reconciles us to the Father (see [Hebrews 2:17](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/2/Hebrews-2-17.html); [4:14](https://www.bibleref.com/Hebrews/4/Hebrews-4-14.html)); and a king, because after His resurrection God gave all authority to Him (see [John 18:36](https://www.bibleref.com/John/18/John-18-36.html); [Ephesians 1:20–23](https://www.bibleref.com/Ephesians/1/Ephesians-1-20.html); and [Revelation 19:16](https://www.bibleref.com/Revelation/19/Revelation-19-16.html)).

The Jews of Jesus’ day expected the Messiah to redeem Israel by overthrowing the rule of the Romans and establishing an earthly kingdom (see [Acts 1:6](https://www.bibleref.com/Acts/1/Acts-1-6.html)). It wasn’t until after Jesus’ resurrection that His disciples finally began to understand what the prophecies in the Old Testament really meant the Messiah would do (see [Luke 24:25–27](https://www.bibleref.com/Luke/24/Luke-24-25.html)). The Messiah was “anointed” first to deliver His people *spiritually*; that is, to redeem them from sin ([John 8:31–36](https://www.bibleref.com/John/8/John-8-31.html)). He accomplished this salvation through His death and resurrection ([John 12:32](https://www.bibleref.com/John/12/John-12-32.html); [John 3:16](https://www.bibleref.com/John/3/John-3-16.html)). Later, Jesus the Messiah will deliver His people from their physical enemies, when He sets up His Kingdom on the earth (see [Isaiah 9:1–7](https://www.bibleref.com/Isaiah/9/Isaiah-9-1.html)).
