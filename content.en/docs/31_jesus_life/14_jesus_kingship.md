# INTRODUCTION

The history of humanity is often written according to the reigns of powerful kings. We've all heard of kings who ruled large portions of Asia, Europe, Africa and Latin America. Some of them conquered so many enemies that their empires seemed to stretch to the far corners of the earth. And they all have at least one thing in common. They're gone; they're dead; they don't rule any more. Their mighty armies have disappeared, and their power has vanished.

There's only been one exception to this rule. There's one king whose power has never faded, and whose kingdom will never end. And that king, of course, is Jesus.

This is the fifth lesson in our series, *We Believe in Jesus*, and we have entitled it "The King." In this lesson, we'll see how Jesus fulfills the Old Testament office of king, ruling as God's faithful servant and Son. As we've seen in prior lessons, at various stages of Old Testament history God instituted three offices through which he administered his kingdom: the offices of prophet, priest and king. And in the final stage of God's kingdom, which we commonly call the New Testament age, all three of these offices find their ultimate fulfillment in Jesus. In this lesson, we'll focus on Jesus' office of king.

For our purposes, we'll define a king as:

> A human being established by God to exercise rule on God's behalf over his kingdom.
> 

As this definition indicates, God always has been and always will be the ultimate ruler over all creation. But he has also appointed human beings to serve as his vice-regents. These human kings serve under him, and further his purposes and goals for his kingdom. As we keep this basic definition in mind, we will be able to gain many insights into the biblical office of king, and into how Jesus fulfills this office.

This lesson will follow the same format as our lessons on Jesus' offices of prophet and priest. First, we will examine the Old Testament background to the office of king. Second, we will explore the fulfillment of the office of king, in Jesus. And third, we will explore the modern application of Jesus' kingship to our own lives. Let's look first at the Old Testament background to Jesus' office of king.

# OLD TESTAMENT BACKGROUND

In his book The Republic, the Greek philosopher Plato argued that the best of all possible governments was the rule of a philosopher king. In his view, kings that truly loved wisdom, instead of wealth and power, would direct their nations toward countless benefits. In a similar way, Scripture shows that when Israel's kings feared God and followed his precepts, their nations thrived under God's blessings. But the opposite was also true: When they rebelled against God, the entire nation suffered under God's judgment. In this sense, Israel's kings were central to the well-being of God's kingdom on earth.

We'll examine the Old Testament background to the office of king by looking at three topics: first, the qualifications for the office of king; second, the function of kings; and third, the expectations the Old Testament created for the future of kingship in Israel. Let's begin with the qualifications for the office of king.

## Qualifications

In the Old Testament, God revealed the qualifications for kings in two stages. First, in the Law of Moses, God revealed the standards for kingship even before Israel had a king. And second, God's covenant with David provided an important additional qualification once the monarchy was in place. Let's look first at the principles of kingship listed in the Law of Moses.

### Law of Moses

> It's interesting when you read the Old Testament, particularly the first five books, the Pentateuch, that already there you have anticipation of the coming of a king. You have what the king should be like and should do long before there's ever kings. Why is this the case? Well, I think we need to put those kind of passages, Deuteronomy 17 particularly, where you have the anticipation of the king and what the king should do, in light of God's plan. You really have to go back to Adam. Adam functions as kind of prophet, priest, king. His dominion over this earth, that rule and kingship, in some sense is lost. It's picked up in the nation of Israel through the Abrahamic covenant. Even in Genesis 17 there's promises that through Abraham's line kings will come. That then begins to be realized in Israel and uniquely the king. The king in the Old Testament, even though it's announced many, many years ahead of time in say, Deuteronomy 17 with Moses, is setting us up for the return of the effects of sin upon this world, the restoration that will come through the kings, the Davidic kings. But even more than that, the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ who now takes these roles, fulfills the Davidic role, fulfills Israel's role, fulfills ultimately Adam's role, and restores us back to what we were made to be, so that all of this is in anticipation. All of this is setting us up for more in terms of God's plan as it unfolds, leading us to the messianic theme of "This is what will come. This is who will take place. This is how the king will fulfill those roles." All of that, I think, is the reason why Moses is giving us this before there's ever kings. [Dr. Stephen Wellum]
> 

As Moses prepared the nation of Israel to enter and conquer the Promised Land, he explained that God would eventually appoint a king over them. And he listed four principles that were to guide the king that God appointed. Listen to what Moses wrote in Deuteronomy 17:14-19:

> When you … have taken possession of it and settled in it … appoint over you the king the Lord your God chooses. He must be from among your own brothers… The king, moreover, must not acquire great numbers of horses for himself or make the people return to Egypt to get more of them … He must not take many wives … He must not accumulate large amounts of silver and gold… [H]e is to write … a copy of this law … and he is to read it all the days of his life so that he may learn to revere the Lord his God and follow carefully all the words of this law and these decrees (Deuteronomy 17:14-19).
> 

Moses listed four principles relating to the qualifications for kingship. First, he said that Israel's king had to be chosen by God. The people were not qualified to choose a king that would lead them in the way that God demanded. And they didn't have the right to vest a person with God's delegated authority. Only God could delegate his own authority. And he would only give it to a person of his choosing.

The second thing Moses mentioned in Deuteronomy 17 was that the king had to be an Israelite. That is to say, he had to be a native of God's chosen nation. This was to fulfill the covenant promise God had made to Abraham in Genesis 17:1-8, where he swore that Abraham's heirs would be kings over their people.

The third qualification in Deuteronomy 17 was that the king was to depend on God rather than on human strategies for securing peace and prosperity. Moses listed four ways that kings might turn from dependence on God.

- The king was forbidden to acquire large numbers of horses probably because they were important for his army. The king was to depend on God's power, and not on human might, in order to secure the nation.
- The ban on returning to Egypt referred to submitting to a larger empire for protection and provision, rather than submitting to God.
- The prohibition against many wives probably applied specifically to political alliances forged through arranged marriages. This was problematic not just because it made Israel dependent on foreign countries rather than on God, but also because foreign wives were likely to serve foreign gods, and to tempt the king to do the same.
- And the command against accumulating large amounts of gold and silver probably referred to unjust taxation. It was not wrong for the king to be rich. But it was criminal for him to become rich by oppressing God's people.

As a whole, these restrictions ensured that the king would rely on God for the success of his reign and the security of the nation.

The fourth thing Moses stressed in Deuteronomy 17 was that the king was required to demonstrate covenant fidelity to God by receiving, copying and meditating on God's covenant law. These actions were designed to cultivate personal reverence, appropriate humility and faithful rule.

> The kings of Israel and the kings of Judah were the representative of the people to God, so that in many ways they had a sacramental presence there, both as the representative of God on earth and the representative of the people to God. So, that particular swing status that they had was significant in how God responded to both the king and then ultimately how that fell out onto the nation as a whole. And you had this whole history, I think, within Israel and Judah. There are no good kings in Israel. They were all bad. And then, they fell first in 722 B. C. But then within Judah, you had this sort of back and forth, where you'd have a good king, he did right in the eyes of the Lord, and then a bad king who did evil in the sight of the Lord. But when the bad kings did evil in the sight of the Lord, there were major repercussions that came from that. This was where the divine "No" of God's judgment would be heralded against both the king and then also the people as well. And it seems to be that there was a…there's an organic relationship between the status of the king and the way in which the people followed in that. If the king was setting up high places and worshipping foreign gods, the people were as well. And then vice versa; when there were reforms, like we had with King Josiah, that had huge national repercussions for the way in which the people responded to God and his Law. So, the king had a major role in representing both the people and God to the people. [Dr. Mark Gignilliat]
> 

Having seen the qualifications for kingship revealed by Moses, we're ready to consider an additional qualification God established in his covenant with David.

### Covenant with David

God established his covenant with David in 2 Samuel 7:8-16, and its terms are mentioned in places like Psalms 89 and 132. This covenant established David's descendants as Israel's permanent dynasty. God demonstrated great benevolence to David and to Israel by ensuring that David's descendants would reign, and that Israel would enjoy the stability of dynastic succession. Listen to God's covenant promises to David in 2 Samuel 7:8-16:

> I took you from the pasture and from following the flock to be ruler over my people Israel… Now I will make your name great … And I will provide a place for my people Israel … I will also give you rest from all your enemies… I will raise up your offspring to succeed you, who will come from your own body, and I will establish his kingdom… Your house and your kingdom will endure forever before me; your throne will be established forever (2 Samuel 7:8-16).
> 

According to this divine covenant, God added a new qualification for kings in Israel: From this time on, God's people were to be led by a son of David. Only his house could claim legitimate, perpetual rule over the entire nation.

As early as the book of Genesis, God blessed the tribe of Judah with Israel's kingship. "The scepter will not depart from Judah," Jacob said in Genesis 49. Since David was from the tribe of Judah, God's promise to David was the fulfillment of this blessing in Genesis. God always intended that Israel would one day have a king from the tribe of Judah. Because of David's obedience and devotion to God, he promised that Israel's kingship would perpetually be traced through David's line. No person could ever legitimately claim to be king in Israel unless he was from David's house. That's why it was so important for the writers of the Gospels to prove, not just that Jesus was called by God, but that he was a direct descendent of David with a legitimate claim to David's throne.

Now that we've looked at the qualifications for kingship, let's turn to our second topic, the function of kings in the Old Testament.

## Function

In the Old Testament, the kings of Israel exercised faithful rule over God's people primarily by executing and administering God's law. As we've seen in prior lessons, it was common for powerful emperors or suzerains in the ancient Near East to conquer and control weaker kingdoms, making them their servants or vassals. These suzerains normally administered their relationships with their vassals through treaties or covenants, which required the vassal kingdoms to serve the conquering suzerain by submitting to his laws. And the same thing was true of Israel's relationship to God. The entire nation was responsible to obey God's covenant, and the king was to ensure that they did.

Kings held their people accountable to God's covenant law in many ways. But for our purposes in this lesson, we'll focus on what Jesus called the more important matters of the law. As Jesus said in Matthew 23:23:

> The more important matters of the law [are] justice, mercy and faithfulness (Matthew 23:23).
> 

According to Jesus, and in contrast with the Pharisees' focus on ceremonies and rituals, the most important characteristics of the law are justice, mercy and faithfulness.

We'll consider the ways Old Testament kings executed and administered God's laws according to each of these most important characteristics. First, we'll look at the king's responsibility to enforce justice. Second, we'll see that the king was to apply mercy. And third, we'll focus on the fact that the king was to promote faithfulness. Let's look first at the king's function of enforcing justice.

### Justice

In the context of a king's responsibilities, justice can be defined as judging every person as he deserves, in accordance with God's law.

> As individuals or rulers, we have the right, the freedom, and the will to choose a safe path or a sinful path. In the end God's judgment will fall on us all. As a result those rulers will be judged. When Jesus comes he will put all things where they should be. Until then we have a mission. And that is to live as individuals that belong to God's kingdom, and as citizens in a heavenly earth. For the time being, we practice justice and equality, respecting others, respecting the weak, being fair with the unjust, and we try hard to achieve justice knowing that we still live in a sinful world, a broken world, in a world under God's judgment, in a world where brutality, poverty, ignorance and corruption still exist. We are like a candle that gives light, reminding others that there is a loving God in heaven who cares about the unjust and that this brutality, corruption, and arrogance, no matter how long it lasts on earth, it is temporary, and limited in time because there is a God who will, in the end, fix everything. [Dr. Jonathan Kuttab, translation]
> 

Israel's kings were to execute God's justice on at least two different levels. In the first place, they executed God's international justice, enforcing God's law between Israel and other nations.

One way kings upheld justice on an international scale was by peacefully negotiating with other nations, as Solomon did with Hiram the king of Tyre in 1 Kings 5:1-12.

Kings also pursued international justice through war. They did this by punishing wicked nations as Saul did in 1 Samuel 14:47-48, and as David did in 2 Samuel 8:1-13. The king also defended Israel when they were attacked, as David did in 2 Samuel 5:17-25, and as Hezekiah did in 2 Kings 19. Psalm 2 summarizes the justice that Israel's kings were to render toward nations that rebelled against them and the Lord. Listen to what it says in verses 6-12:

> [The Lord said,] "I have installed my King on Zion, my holy hill." … He said to me, "You are my Son; today I have become your Father. Ask of me, and I will make the nations your inheritance, the ends of the earth your possession. You will rule them with an iron scepter; you will dash them to pieces like pottery." Therefore, you kings, be wise; be warned, you rulers of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear and rejoice with trembling. Kiss the Son, lest he be angry and you be destroyed in your way, for his wrath can flare up in a moment. Blessed are all who take refuge in him (Psalm 2:6-12).
> 

These verses follow the ancient Near-Eastern custom of referring to the suzerain as a father and his vassal king as his son. In this case, God was the suzerain and the Davidic king was the son. And God's plan for the world was for the nations to serve and obey the Davidic king. They were to fear and honor him because he was God's instrument of justice in the world.

In the second place, kings were also responsible to execute God's justice on a national scale, within Israel. Kings enforced national justice by leading God's special people in obedience to his law. This included things like providing for the well-being and protection of the weak, as we see in Proverbs 29:14; defending against the wicked, as David modeled in 2 Samuel 4:9-12; prosecuting criminals, as in 2 Kings 14:5; and establishing stability for the growth and prosperity of the citizens, as Psalm 72 teaches. Moreover, kings were not to distort justice to favor the rich or the poor, the powerful or the weak. Scripture speaks of this role of kings in many places, including Leviticus 19:15 and Isaiah 11:1-5.

Drawing once again from Jesus' identification of the more important matters of the law, a second major way kings were to apply God's law was in mercy.

### Mercy

Mercy is the imitation of God's compassion toward his creatures. God often treats his creatures with forbearance when they have sinned, and in understanding of their weakness. He grants them good things in life, and relief from suffering, simply because it pleases him to be kind to what he has made. Scripture speaks of God's mercy in many places, such as Psalm 40:11; Psalm 103:8; and Jonah 4:2.

As with justice, we'll highlight the fact that kings were to show mercy in at least two arenas, beginning with international relations. On an international level, kings applied mercy to those nations and people who submitted to the God of Israel. For example, in 2 Samuel 10:19, many vassals of one of Israel's enemies received mercy from David when they made peace with him. And in 2 Samuel 10:1-2, David showed compassion to the king of the Ammonites.

Moreover, Old Testament prophets foretold that the Gentile nations would eventually submit to Jerusalem. They would bring tribute to the capital city of God's kingdom, and receive mercy and protection from God's king. These things are prophesied in places like Isaiah 60:1-22 and 66:18-23, Micah 4:1-8, and Zephaniah 2:11.

Of course, as we've seen in our discussion of justice, God doesn't always want to show mercy. And sometimes he demanded that the king withhold mercy from wicked nations. For example, in 2 Samuel 5:17-25, God instructed David to destroy the Philistines, which David did without mercy. Their evil was so great that they were not to be spared. So, part of the king's responsibility was to discern when God would have him show mercy, and when God would have him withhold it.

Besides showing mercy in international relations, the king was also responsible to administer God's law by showing mercy on a national level. Because the king was God's vassal, he was required to treat God's people in the same way that God would treat them. And this meant treating them mercifully. As we read in places like Hosea 6:6, God wanted his people to show mercy even more than he wanted the sacrifices required in the law. This is not because God's law is unimportant, but rather because mercy is one of the more important matters of the law. For this reason, a merciful king was an ideal leader, one who imaged God's own pattern of care. David exemplified this in places like 2 Samuel 19:18-23, where he showed mercy to enemies that submitted to him.

> Mercy is throughout the Old Testament law. If we can get over our bias sometimes that the law is bad and really read the law as a vehicle of God's loving-kindness, we'll begin to see it everywhere. So even if we look at the Ten Commandments as a starting point, you see a law such as the fourth commandment to keep the Sabbath holy. We have to read beyond that first part of the commandment to see that not only are we to rest on the Lord's Day, or the Sabbath, but we are to allow our household servants, our livestock, all that's under our possession. In our modern world, we would say a God-fearing man or woman who has a business should be merciful to his or her employees and not treat them as resources to be mined or exhausted, but rather treat them as people. To be a steward over the people God has placed over us. So there's a merciful provision there. You see a lot of individual detailed laws in the Old Testament that show mercy. The command in Deuteronomy to leave the gleanings in the corner of the field, so that those who are needy could come along and have something to eat, so they could pick what was left over. You have other Old Testament laws such as the command not to charge interest to a countryman. In that world it's not a capitalist investment economy, and the charging of interest was often a way to abuse and take advantage of people. It would become a substitute for generosity. If one could make an advantage off of a needy fellow Israelite, he could enrich himself, but he would end up depriving the other. So the command says, don't do that. Instead, be generous by not charging interest, and lend to those who have need. The law of release from indenturement every seven years or the law of Jubilee that restored people to the land that unfortunate providences had taken them away from, unfortunate circumstances, so these laws of restoration. God was merciful to his people, and then he commands them to reflect his own character in the laws of the Old Testament. [Rev. Mike Glodo]
> 

In addition to justice and mercy, a third way the king was to execute God's law was by promoting faithfulness to God.

### Faithfulness

Faithfulness can be defined as loyalty to God, demonstrated through heartfelt trust and obedience. Faithfulness involves believing that God is who he says he is, loyally serving him and no other gods, and rendering him loving obedience.

As we did with justice and mercy, we'll consider two ways the king was obligated to promote faithfulness, beginning with the international arena. The kings of Israel were to lead God's people toward fidelity to God in such a way that the surrounding nations would repent of their idolatry and sin, and begin to serve God. Kings fulfilled this role especially by establishing faithful worship in the nation of Israel, as we see in Solomon's prayer at the dedication of the temple in 1 Kings 8:41-43. This global mandate to disciple and discipline the nations is also indicated in passages like Psalm 72:8-11, and Zechariah 8:20-23.

Besides promoting faithfulness to God internationally, the king was also to encourage faithfulness on a national level. The king was to promote faithfulness within the nation of Israel especially by ensuring and providing for purity in worship. Good kings provided resources and plans for worship, organized the personnel, dictated policies for the maintenance of the temple, and often played important roles in the public celebrations of worship. For example, David did these things in 1 Chronicles 15, 16, and 23–28.

The king's commitment to promoting Israel's faithfulness affected the nation in profound ways. Because he was the nation's representative before God, the people often experienced heightened blessings under the leadership of faithful kings, and heightened judgments under faithless kings. God blessed faithful kings with prosperity in Israel and the physical expansion of Israel's borders. Unfaithful kings would be punished as well. In fact, the book of Kings partially blames the exile of Judah on the disobedience of Israel's kings.

Listen to God's words to King Solomon in 1 Kings 9:6-7:

> If you or your sons turn away from me and do not observe the commands and decrees I have given you and go off to serve other gods and worship them, then I will cut off Israel from the land I have given them and will reject this temple I have consecrated for my Name. Israel will then become a byword and an object of ridicule among all peoples (1 Kings 9:6-7).
> 

Sadly, not every king of Israel and Judah was faithful to God, and the people often suffered as a result. But even when the temple had been neglected or the people had fallen into idolatry, faithful kings were often able to reform and restore the nation's worship. We see this with Hezekiah in 2 Kings 18:1-8, and with Josiah in 2 Kings 22:1–23:25. Their reform efforts encouraged and even produced faithfulness among God's people, and thereby encouraged God to bless the nation during their reigns.

Having seen the qualifications and functions of Old Testament kings, we're ready to look at the expectations the Old Testament created for the future of kingship in Israel.

## Expectations

The Old Testament established many expectations for future kings, and especially for the one special messianic king that was prophesied to fulfill God's goal of establishing his kingdom on earth. And of course, the New Testament reveals that this messianic king was Jesus. So, we should look at these Old Testament anticipations in some detail.

We'll look at the expectations for the future of kingship in Israel that were created by two sources: first, the historical development of kingship in the Old Testament; and second, specific prophecies about a future king over Israel. Let's look first at the expectations created by the historical development of kingship.

### Historical Development

We'll begin by looking at the vital role human kingship played in God's plan before the monarchy in Israel, from the days of creation to the time of Israel's judges.

### Before the Monarchy

When God created the world, he placed Adam and Eve in the Garden of Eden to serve as his vice-regents over creation. God indicated this role for humanity in Genesis 1:26-27, where he planned and created Adam and Eve in his image.

In the days of the Old Testament, terms like "image of god," "likeness of the gods," and the "son of god" were commonly used to refer to kings and emperors. This terminology expressed the belief that kings were earthly representatives or viceroys of their gods. It was the king's job to ensure that his god's will was accomplished on earth. So, when the Bible calls Adam and Eve images of God, one thing it means is that God appointed the entire human race to be his vice-regents on earth. In the broadest sense, then, all human beings were created to live as royalty, as God's servant kings who ensure that his will is done on earth. The idea that divine images were royal figures helps explain Genesis 1:28, where God gave this mandate to our first parents:

> Be fruitful and increase in number; fill the earth and subdue it. Rule over the fish of the sea and the birds of the air and over every living creature that moves on the ground (Genesis 1:28).
> 

God wanted to turn the entire earth into his kingdom. So, he appointed his vice-regents, the human race, both to fill the world with additional images of God, and to exercise dominion or rule over the entire creation. This command is often called the cultural mandate because it commands us to build God's kingdom by establishing cultures and civilizations throughout the world.

After Adam and Eve fell into sin, they and their descendants strayed so far from their original responsibilities that God judged sinful humanity in Noah's flood. Even so, God didn't cancel humanity's royal function in the world. After Noah and his family had exited the ark, God reaffirmed the cultural mandate, commanding all his royal images to spread God-honoring civilization around the world.

But the vice-regency of humanity shifted in a significant way in the days of Abraham. God redeemed Abraham and made him the father of his chosen people, Israel. Although all human beings were still God's vice-regents in a general sense, the Lord chose Abraham and his descendants to be the firstborn of all the families of earth. God made a special covenant with Abraham in Genesis 15 and 17 indicating that Israel had the special, royal privilege of building a holy nation for God. And this nation was to be the starting point for spreading God's will to all other nations.

Later in history, God began to fulfill his promises to Abraham by sending Moses and then Joshua to lead Israel. Under their rule, God rescued his people from slavery in Egypt, and empowered them to conquer Canaan — the Promised Land — where they were to become a large nation of redeemed, holy images of God.

Sadly, Israel failed to complete the conquest of Canaan. So, after Joshua died, national unity disintegrated and various local judges and Levites led the tribes through a very troubled time. Although God blessed Israel during these years, the leadership of judges and Levites was not adequate to move Israel toward success as the leading nation of God's royal images. The writer of the book of Judges made this plain throughout his book. Listen to the final line of his book in Judges 21:25:

> In those days Israel had no king; everyone did as he saw fit (Judges 21:25).
> 

Very similar comments appear in Judges 17:6, 18:1, and 19:1. These repetitions emphasized that Israel could move forward as God's chosen nation only under the rule of a righteous king who served as God's special vice-regent.

> Well, the book of Judges seems to be a rationale for the coming of the king. There's a cycle in the book of Judges that the judge is raised up, it's okay for a while, the people fall into sin, they cry out to God and God raises up another judge. And the author clearly wants to make the point that there needs to be something more stable, more secure, and longs for a ruler and a leader after God's own heart. And of course that attribute is particularly applied to David, the king after God's own heart, and who is seen as something of a model of what kingship looks like, not only for the people of Israel then, but actually for how God exercises his rule over his people. So, the book of Judges then is something of a polemic for the need for a king, a king who would rule under God, who would show us how God rules his people both then, and indeed even today. [Dr. Simon Vibert]
> 

> It's important to put the book of Judges in the entire plan of God, the storyline from Genesis all the way to the coming of Jesus Christ. The book of Judges is looking back to the previous revelation, all the way to Adam as a kingly figure, Abraham in the Abrahamic covenant anticipating coming of kings through his line, Moses giving the old covenant, Deuteronomy 17, where there's the coming of the king anticipated. Yet, there is, not at that point in God's plan, the actual kings that are coming. Judges then, in some sense, is showing the need for leaders, the need for rule. Joshua picks up from Moses; the judges pick up from Joshua. Yet, there is no king that God has been anticipating. There is no fulfillment of that yet. The judges are, depending on their leadership, if they're good the nation usually does not too badly. If they're evil the nation does poorly, and there is no king. When the king comes, Judges is saying to us, things will be better. Things will be fulfilled from what the Old Testament has given to us. And then, of course, we move from Judges to then the Saul and David, sort of set over against one another — the people's king, God's king — which again leads us to the great Davidic Covenant, the promises of David's greater son. All of this is part of God's plan, setting us up for the coming of the Lord Jesus Christ, showing us what the true king will be like in contrast to these other kings, the need for a king to restore what we were once made to be. And all of that is part of God's plan that is leading us to Jesus Christ [Dr. Stephen Wellum]
> 

Now that we've looked at the origins of human kingship in the days before Israel's monarchy, let's turn to the historical developments during the monarchy in Israel.

### Monarchy

According to 1 Samuel 8:5-20, at the end of the period of the judges the nation of Israel envied the stability and order kings provided to surrounding nations. But they refused to wait for God to raise up a king in his own time. Instead, they demanded that he give them a king immediately. In response, God appointed Saul as the first official king over Israel.

Now it's important to realize that Israel's desire for a human king wasn't sinful in itself. God had revealed several times beforehand that he planned for Israel to become a mighty nation with a great human king. For example, in Genesis 17:6, God promised Abraham that kings would be included among his descendants. In Genesis 49:8-10, Jacob blessed his son Judah by announcing that one of Judah's descendants would rule as king over Israel. And as we saw earlier in this lesson, Moses even prescribed regulations for Israel's kings in Deuteronomy 17:14-19. Beyond this, in 1 Samuel 2:10, shortly before Israel pressed God to give them a king, righteous Hannah had offered a prophetic prayer that God would eventually establish a righteous king over his people.

But despite God's good plans for kingship in Israel, the nation sinned by refusing to trust God and to wait for his timing. And God's appointment of Saul as their king was intended partly to discipline them for this sin. And while Saul did move Israel forward in some ways, his own rebellion against God's caused the Lord to depose him and his family.

But after Saul's failure, God graciously gave Israel the kind of king they needed by raising up David as their king. Like all the rest of fallen humanity, David was a sinner. But he was also a man after God's own heart. And God empowered him to unite the nation, defeat their enemies, and bring security and prosperity to Israel. Moreover, God made a covenant with David so that his descendants would always rule over Israel as their permanent royal dynasty. We read about this covenant in places like 2 Samuel 7; 1 Chronicles 17; and Psalms 89, 132.

When David died, his son Solomon succeeded him as king. In many ways, Solomon's reign was the high point in the history of Israel's kings. He expanded the territories of Israel, and increased its wealth and good reputation. Sadly, he also seriously violated God's law by worshipping the gods of his foreign wives. So, the Lord divided the kingdom in the days of Solomon's son Rehoboam. And the generations that followed were even more unfaithful to God, so that eventually both Israel and Judah came under God's judgment and were exiled from their lands. The northern kingdom of Israel was conquered by Assyria in 723 or 722 B.C., and the southern kingdom of Judah was conquered by Babylon in 587 or 586 B.C. The last legitimate king was David's descendant Jehoiachin, also known as Jeconiah who was deposed and carried into captivity in 597 B.C.

By the end of the monarchical period, God had revealed a great deal about human kingship. In the broadest sense, all human beings were God's vice-regents over the earth. In a narrower sense, the nation of Israel held a special vice-regency as the sacred family of humanity that was to be a model for other nations. And in the narrowest sense, David's royal descendants occupied the office of God's chief vice-regent. God ordained the sons of David to lead the Israelites and the rest of the world in service to the will of the supreme king, God himself.

Now that we've looked at the historical development of the office of king before and during Israel's monarchy, let's explore the period after the monarchy, when Israel and Judah lived in exile and there was no Davidic king.

### Exile

Although the Babylonians had destroyed Jerusalem and removed David's heir from his throne, the Persian emperor Cyrus conquered Babylon and decreed that the Israelites could return to the Promised Land. We read of this development in 2 Chronicles 36 and Ezra 1.

The years following Cyrus' edict are often called the period of restoration. The returnees re-consecrated the altar of God, built a new temple, and rebuilt Jerusalem's walls. Early on, in Haggai 2:21-23, the prophet Haggai even told this restored remnant that if they were faithful, God might appoint their governor Zerubbabel, who was a descendant of David, to David's throne. But the people weren't faithful to God. So, the Old Testament ends with only a remnant of Israelites living in the Promised Land, with their hopes of glory postponed into the future.

In the time between the Old and New Testaments, Israel's apostasy continued to delay the restoration of kingship in Israel. The Greek Empire defeated the Persian Empire and took control over the Israelites in Palestine. And later, the Roman Empire defeated the Greeks and took charge over the Promised Land. During all of this time, Israel had no king ordained by God.

The pitiful condition of Israel under the oppression of the Assyrians, the Babylonians, the Medes and the Persians, the Greeks and the Romans demonstrated one thing very clearly: the reign of a righteous son of David was critical to the future. Israel needed a Davidic king to fulfill its role in the world as God's chosen people. So, the faithful people of God continued to look forward to the time when God would honor his covenant with David by sending a righteous Davidic king to rescue them from their oppressors and to extend the will of God over the entire world.

Now that we've looked at the historical developments of the office of king, let's consider the expectations for the future of kingship that rose from specific prophecies in the Old Testament.

### Specific Prophecies

The Old Testament contains far too many prophecies about the future of kingship in Israel for us to mention them all. So, for our purposes in this lesson, we'll mention just four important themes. In the first place, Old Testament prophets predicted that God would restore the Davidic dynasty.

> The Old Testament especially emphasizes the Messiah is first of all a son of David. Of course, David was that great king of Israel who trusted in the Lord so significantly, won powerful victories, in many, many ways obeyed the Lord. Of course he had some significant failings as well, but David becomes the paradigm of what the Messiah will be. He will be a ruler who brings peace to the nation. And so we see in the latter part of the Old Testament after David has died there is an expectation that a son of David will come and that's especially aligned with the idea that there will be peace and righteousness and joy. [Dr. Thomas Schreiner]
> 

> But, in the Old Testament the figure who became known as the Messiah was the king, was the king from David's line. David was given a covenant by God and in that covenant he was promised that one day God would raise up a king who would have a special, unique Son of God relationship, relationship with God as his son, who would reign forever on the throne of David, who would establish justice and righteousness. So really, when we refer to the Old Testament Messiah, we're referring to a king, the ultimate king, the king who would bring God's salvation and deliverance. [Dr. Mark Strauss]
> 

The prophets said that God would eventually send a righteous Son of David to restore Davidic kingship to Israel. We see this in many places, including Psalm 89, Isaiah 9:7 and 16:5, Jeremiah 23:5 and 33:25-26, and Ezekiel 34:23-24. As just one example, listen to what God said through the prophet Amos in Amos 9:11:

> In that day I will restore David's fallen tent. I will repair its broken places, restore its ruins, and build it as it used to be (Amos 9:11).
> 

In the second place, the prophets predicted that this future son of David would give God's people freedom and victory over their enemies. The Old Testament prophets frequently spoke of a time when God would dramatically intervene in history to conquer his enemies on behalf of his faithful people. God promised to render judgment against all those who opposed his ways, including the unfaithful within Israel. And the prophets repeatedly associated this victory with the future heir of David's throne, who would act as God's great vice-regent. These expectations are prophesied in places like Psalm 132:17-18, Isaiah 9:4-7, Jeremiah 30:5-17, Ezekiel 34:2, and Zechariah 12:1-10. For instance, listen to this prophecy in Jeremiah 30:8-9:

> "In that day," declares the Lord Almighty, "I will break the yoke off their necks and will tear off their bonds; no longer will foreigners enslave them. Instead, they will serve the Lord their God and David their king, whom I will raise up for them" (Jeremiah 30:8-9).
> 

In the third place, Old Testament prophets predicted that this future Son of David would establish an everlasting kingdom. The Old Testament prophets regularly taught that when the great Son of David ruled over Israel, they would enjoy God's blessings forever. The Davidic king's reign would make earth like heaven, and his people would live enduringly in peace and prosperity. This expectation appears in passages like Isaiah 55:3-13, and Ezekiel 37:24-25. For example, listen to what Isaiah said about the future son of David in Isaiah 9:7:

> Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end. He will reign on David's throne and over his kingdom, establishing and upholding it with justice and righteousness from that time on and forever. The zeal of the Lord Almighty will accomplish this (Isaiah 9:7).
> 

And in the fourth place, the prophets also taught that this future son of David would establish a worldwide kingdom. The future Davidic kingdom would be limitless not only in time, but also in geography. It would expand to fill the entire earth. All who repented of their sins would enjoy its blessings, regardless of their nationality or ethnicity. We see instances of this in Psalms 2, 68, 72, 110, and 122. Listen to the way Daniel 7:13-14, describes this aspect of the future king and his kingdom:

> There before me was one like a son of man, coming with the clouds of heaven… He was given authority, glory and sovereign power; all peoples, nations and men of every language worshiped him (Daniel 7:13-14).
> 

> One of the key texts in the Old Testament for understanding the role of the Messiah is Psalm 2, which is a very clear prediction that God has appointed a special king, who he's appointed on his holy hill, on Zion. And when you read it carefully you discover this king that God is going to appoint is also going to be the one who is going to be the ruler over the nations. The obedience of the nations will be his. And he's an authoritative figure that all nations, and all the rulers of the earth are meant to come down, and effectively to worship, "to kiss the Son," is the phrase in Psalm 2. It's this idea that he's not just Israel's Messiah, although he is, but because he's Israel's Messiah, he's also the Lord over the whole world, the rightful Lord over the whole world. So one of the key things to understand is that the Messiah was a human figure, actually, it was understood it was to be a human figure who is going to come and is going to be the ruler of the world. [Dr. Peter Walker]
> 

The Old Testament ended with great hopes for the future of kingship. God would send a special son of David, a supreme vice-regent. He would defeat all the enemies of God's people. And he would establish an everlasting kingdom on earth for everyone that would submit to his rule. This kingdom would fulfill God's original purpose for humanity as the image of God; it would fulfill God's original purpose for Israel; and it would fulfill God's original purpose for establishing David's throne. The righteous Son of David would turn the entire world into God's kingdom, and purge it of all evil, and establish peace and prosperity for all his people for all time.

Having explored the Old Testament background to the office of King, we're ready to turn to our second major topic: the fulfillment of the office of king in Jesus.

# FULFILLMENT IN JESUS

The New Testament clearly teaches that Jesus is the Davidic king promised in the Old Testament. For example, the Magi described him as the king of the Jews in Matthew 2:2. Jesus' disciples attributed royal titles such as Messiah or Christ to him in places like Mark 8:27-29. He was called the king of Israel in John 1:49. And most importantly, just before his death, Jesus himself claimed to be the Messianic king promised by the Old Testament. Listen to his conversation with Pontius Pilate in Matthew 27:11:

> The governor asked him, "Are you the king of the Jews?" "Yes, it is as you say," Jesus replied (Matthew 27:11).
> 

We find similar reports in Mark 15:2, Luke 23:1-3, and John 18:33-37. Even though Jesus didn't ascend to the throne of Israel during his earthly ministry, the New Testament clearly teaches that he really is the promised Davidic king. And he will return in the future to fulfill every Old Testament expectation for the throne of David.

We'll examine the fulfillment of the office of king in the person of Jesus in ways that correspond to our survey of the Old Testament background to this office. First, we'll see that Jesus fulfilled the qualifications for the office of king. Second, we'll note that Jesus modeled the function of kings. And third, we'll explore the ways Jesus met the expectations the Old Testament created for the future of kingly service. Let's begin with Jesus' kingly qualifications.

## Qualifications

Earlier in this lesson we saw that the Law of Moses listed four qualifications for kings. First, the king had to be chosen by God. Second, he had to be an Israelite. Third, he had to depend on God for success and security. And fourth, he had to maintain covenant fidelity in his rule and in his personal life. And beyond these qualifications, the covenant with David specified that the king had to be a son of David. At this point in our lesson, let's look at how Jesus met each of these qualifications, beginning with being chosen by God.

### Chosen by God

As we've seen before, God is the great emperor or suzerain over all creation. And the king of Israel was the servant king or vassal over God's special, holy nation Israel. And since only God can delegate his own authority, he himself had to choose all the legitimate kings that were to receive and exercise a measure of God's authority over his nation.

Jesus met this qualification because God selected and designated him to be king over Israel. We see this in Jesus' genealogy in Matthew 1:1-17, and in the angel Gabriel's announcement to Mary about the birth of Jesus. Listen to Gabriel's words to Mary in Luke 1:31-33:

> You will be with child and give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus. He will be great and will be called the Son of the Most High. The Lord God will give him the throne of his father David, and he will reign over the house of Jacob forever; his kingdom will never end (Luke 1:31-33).
> 

God made it clear that he had chosen Jesus to be the king over his people.

The second qualification for the king was that he had to be an Israelite.

### Israelite

It almost goes without saying that Jesus met the qualification of being an Israelite because he was born into an Israelite family. His miraculous incarnation in the womb of the Virgin Mary made his birth unusual. But he was still a legal child of Joseph and Mary, and a full member of the covenant community of Israel. This is confirmed by Jesus genealogies in Matthew 1 and Luke 3, and also by passages like Romans 9:5 that speak of Jesus having true Israelite ancestry.

The third qualification in the Old Testament was that the king had to depend on God rather than on human strategies for securing peace and prosperity.

### Depend on God

Jesus met this qualification because he depended entirely on God's power to establish security and prosperity for his people. He didn't try to make alliances with Herod or Pilate, or with any other human government. Instead, he relied on God's authority and power to establish and maintain his kingdom, as we see in passages like John 13:3, and 19:10-11.

The fourth Old Testament qualification for king that Jesus met was that he demonstrated covenant fidelity to God through his relationship with God's covenant law.

### Covenant Fidelity

Jesus' fidelity to God's law is seen in many ways, but especially in his adherence to its original meaning and in his dedication to fulfill everything the law required. For example, in the Sermon on the Mount in Matthew 5–7, Jesus repeatedly emphasized the original meaning of what was written in the law, in contrast with the oral teachings of what was said by the teachers of the law. In addition, he specifically said that he had come to fulfill every last detail of the law. Listen to what he said in Matthew 5:17-18:

> Do not think that I have come to abolish the Law or the Prophets; I have not come to abolish them but to fulfill them. I tell you the truth, until heaven and earth disappear, not the smallest letter, not the least stroke of a pen, will by any means disappear from the Law until everything is accomplished (Matthew 5:17-18).
> 

The Apostle Paul echoed this idea in Romans 8:3-4, where he said that Jesus actually had fulfilled the whole law, not just for himself, but on our behalf as well.

> The Bible says that the Law is a schoolmaster that points us to Christ, that brings us to him, prepares us for him. The Law is given and it's a reflection of God's character. But we fail to keep the Law. And so when Jesus comes he shows us perfect humanity fulfilling its intended purpose, which is relationship with God typified with faithfulness to God's commands. So Jesus comes, showing us true humanity in the way it's supposed to be, but also fulfilling that law for us. Jesus fulfills the Law in his continual faithfulness to covenant keeping, law-abiding behavior. So that he becomes our righteousness. The Bible says that God is both just and the justifier. And so he comes with his Law, and then he comes with his Son keeping the Law for us. So he both is the just one, and the one who justifies us in Christ. [Dr. K. Erik Thoennes]
> 

> It's important to stress that Jesus is faithful to the covenant, to be the very basis for his right to rule over us. I mean this is picking up a lot of themes that go really back to Adam. Adam as our head, our representative of the entire human race is, as all of God's creatures, to be obedient, to be faithful. We are the creatures. We are the ones who are to obey our creator, to serve him and to obey him and love him in every area of our life. In his disobedience, he brought with it sin and death and judgment. The only way for that to be reversed is we need God to do the remedy for us and to do so through another Adam, through another human. And so we have the strong emphasis on "God will provide one like an Adam" through these various prophet, priests, and kings, ultimately culminating in our Lord Jesus Christ who, and you think of in the Gospels, he has come to do the will of God. He has come to obey. Galatians 4 says that he was born of a woman, born under the law, to obey all of the law. Well, why is that necessary? Because he has to undo what Adam did. By his obedience — and we think of this not just in terms of his life, but his life is important here too — by his obedience, sometimes we call this his "active obedience," he fulfills all the requirements of the law for us. By his obedience, supremely in his death, Philippians 2, he obeys even unto death on the cross. He is then by virtue of that work, by virtue of that obedience as our king, as our priest, he is exalted to God's right hand. It's not as if he wasn't king before and Lord before. He's always been that as God the Son. Yet, he is God the Son incarnate by his work, and he has to, through his humanity, be obedient, to be faithful, to do that on our behalf, so that he can win for us our salvation. He could not be the one who is given to be King of Kings and Lord of Lords in that messianic work, in that kingly work, without his full obedience and faithfulness unto the Father. [Dr. Stephen Wellum]
> 

The fifth Old Testament qualification Jesus met was that he was a son of David.

### Son of David

God's covenant with David established David's descendants as Israel's permanent dynasty. So, only David's heirs could make a legitimate claim to Israel's kingship. Jesus' membership in David's house is clearly taught in many places in Scripture. To list just a few, we see it in Matthew 1:1-25, Romans 1:1-3, and Revelation 5:5 and 22:16.

Now that we've looked at Jesus' qualifications for kingship, let's turn to the ways Jesus fulfilled the function of kingly service.

## Function

Earlier in this lesson, we said that the basic function of a king is to exercise faithful rule on God's behalf over his vassal nation, especially by administering God's law. Now, all Christians recognize that Jesus did not complete his work during his earthly ministry. In fact, Jesus continues to work from heaven and in the church right now. And he will eventually return to complete his work. He has done more than enough for us to celebrate that he really is the Christ, the Davidic king God sent to restore his kingdom.

We'll consider Jesus' function as king by using the same categories we observed in the Old Testament background to this office: enforcing justice, applying mercy, and promoting faithfulness. Let's look first at the Jesus' enforcement of justice.

### Justice

As in our section on the Old Testament, we'll explore the concept of justice in two arenas, beginning with international justice. During most of his earthly ministry, Jesus didn't directly involve himself with human governments. But he did pursue justice by waging war against the kingdom of Satan and his demons, and by freeing his people from the tyranny of sin. Scripture describes this as a spiritual battle between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of Satan in places like Luke 11:14-20, and Ephesians 2:2. So, it's reasonable to compare it to the ways Old Testament kings pursued international justice through war. As Jesus said in Matthew 12:28:

> If I drive out demons by the Spirit of God, then the kingdom of God has come upon you (Matthew 12:28).
> 

In this verse, Jesus indicated that the exorcisms he performed were proof that he was leading God's kingdom in battle against the kingdom of Satan.

Old Testament kings also executed international justice by engaging in peaceful negotiations with other nations. Although Jesus didn't do this often, he did receive peaceful tribute from the eastern magi, who brought him gifts in Matthew 2. These magi were representatives of foreign nations, and their intent was to foster good will between their nations and Israel's newborn king.

In addition to executing justice internationally, Jesus also upheld God's justice within national Israel. Like other human kings, Jesus didn't normally get involved in personal disputes. Instead, he left them to lesser courts and arbitrators. But he did frequently exhort justice among his people. We see this in places like Matthew 5:25-26, and 12:15-21; as well as Luke 18:7-8. Jesus also guaranteed that he was keeping track of good and evil works in order to repay them when he returned in judgment. This aspect of his royal role is apparent in passages like Matthew 10:15, 11:22-24, and 12:36, where he spoke of specific condemnations that will be made in the future. We also see it in John 5:22, where he indicated that he is the one who will render that condemnation.

In addition to enforcing justice, Jesus fulfilled the function of a king by applying God's law in mercy.

### Mercy

Jesus demonstrated royal mercy by imitating God's compassion toward his creatures. He showed forbearance when people sinned. He understood their weakness. He provided for them. And he granted them relief from their suffering.

> When we think about a king, in our normal human history of kingship, we always think about somebody who has absolute authority. They walk in the room and people begin to bow and do whatever they want, whatever the king desires. But the kingship of Jesus, as in everything in his life, seems to turn the whole world upside-down. I'm thinking of that first chapter in John where it uses the concept of creator there, the one who made the world. It says, "He came to his own and his own received him not." Now for anybody who says, well, I believe Jesus is the King, which I do, and you put a verse like that there, you say well what kind of king would come to a world that he had made and allow himself to be rejected? So I think the showing of mercy is not just because the Lord feels sorry for us, which I'm sure he does, but I think it's because he's trying to reveal something about the inner life of God. Mercy has got to be connected to the triune life. And the Trinity, from my perspective from eternity, the King himself, the Father, Son and Holy Spirit, the King of all the Universe, is a God who three-in-one is giving himself one to another, Father to Son, Son to Father, Spirit to the other two, in this self-giving. So that when Jesus comes to show mercy to sinners, he's expressing that self-giving love, which is the King's self-revelation. He will judge. He will eventually condemn those that don't love him. But when he comes to the earth, he comes to people who have been abused, who have been warped by all kinds of wrong powers and the Devil himself, and this king comes and he says, I'm not going to demand anything of you. First, I'm going to come and give myself to you. So all of his acts of mercy are acts of the Triune God's heart in the world to give oneself away. But that's how our King works. He comes without a demand. He comes with a self-giving. And I think mercy is a marvelous expression of that self-giving love that starts in the heart of God, in the incarnation offered to people wherever Jesus went. And, of course, its climax is on the cross, his mercy to us, the King who would die giving his life away that we might receive the mercy of God for salvation. So he is the only truly merciful King, and he describes what that mercy is in his kingship. [Dr. Bill Ury]
> 

> Jesus comes and shows mercy because he's the merciful one. I'm thinking right now, however, of his beatitudes. There is a couple of them that strike me. The second beatitude went like this: Blessed are those who mourn for they shall be comforted. To me that means blessed are those whose heart is broken over the things that break the heart of God. So when God takes on human flesh and he comes here, he looks around about his world and he sees things that make him sad. And instead of just crying, he says, not only will I shed a tear, but I'll move towards those situations mercifully. It's interesting that Barclay would suggest that the word mercy in the New Testament Greek means to get inside the skin of. So this whole understanding of compassion means that I can feel something of what they're feeling right now. And instead of just saying I'm glad I'm not there, I'm going to be there. I'm going to move towards them, and I'm going to be to them what I believe God the Father wants me to be for them in this moment and this time. [Dr. Matt Friedeman]
> 

We'll look at the way Jesus demonstrated his mercy in two spheres, beginning with the international arena. On an international level, the king was to apply mercy to the nations and people that submitted to God. And Jesus did this in several ways. For one thing, he provided miraculous healing for many Gentiles, who were outside the nation of Israel. For example, he healed the daughter of a Canaanite woman in Matthew 15:28. He healed the servant of a Roman centurion in Matthew 8:13. And he exorcised a legion of demons from a man in the Gentile region of the Decapolis in Mark 5:1-20.

Moreover, Jesus ministered in several Gentile areas, including Tyre, Sidon and the Decapolis, so that his message and works became a light of revelation to the Gentiles, as Simeon had prophesied would happen in Luke 2:32.

But even more obvious than his international mercy was the royal mercy that Jesus displayed on a national level. As the king, Jesus was responsible to treat God's people in the same way that God would have treated them. And this meant treating them mercifully. The ideal king was a merciful one that reflected God's own pattern of care. Jesus showed tremendous mercy to Israel as their king. He spent years patiently instructing and exhorting them. He performed countless miracles — healing their diseases, casting out demons, creating food for the hungry, and even raising the dead.

But perhaps the miracle that best showcases his royal mercy is the healing of the paralytic man, which is recorded in Matthew 9:1-7, Mark 2:1-11, and Luke 5:17-25. In that instance, Jesus not only healed the man's paralysis, but he actually forgave his sins. And he did something similar in Luke 7:36-50, where he forgave the sins of the woman who anointed his feet with perfume.

> It's very, very important to answer the question rightly: Why is it only God that can forgive sins? The biblical answer is, it's because that is the one who we've sinned against. He is the Lord. He is the Creator. He is the one who has made us. We owe him everything. And our sin is first and foremost against him. Now, there's implications of sin for one another. There's implications of sin upon the universe. But first and foremost in our relationship as image bearers before God, our rebellion against him is sin against him. Only he can forgive sins. You think of Psalm 51 where David says, "Against you and you only have I sinned." You think of David's life, I mean, he has sinned against a lot of other people. He's affected the nation; he's affected Uriah; he's affected Bathsheba; he's affected his son. But David rightly sees that ultimately he has sinned before God. Our problem, and the human problem that people fail to realize, is that it's only God who can forgive. It's only God who can solve the problem of our sin. [Dr. Stephen Wellum]
> 

> When I sin against someone or someone sins against me, and the request for forgiveness is made and received, between humans what is happening is one party is saying, "I will not allow the offense that you made against me to be a relational impediment to our ongoing relationship," which is important, which we must do to one another as a reflection of our understanding of how we've been forgiven by God. But when God forgives, he forgives in such a way that actually cancels the objective debt of my guilt, and that's something that I can do for no one else and that no one else can do for me. So God forgives in a way that cancels the objective debt of my guilt. This is divine forgiveness, which makes it very interesting, for example then in Mark 2 when Jesus is healing the paralytic and says to him, "My son, your sins are forgiven." The scribes are sitting there observing this, and in their hearts, we're told, they're sort of silently thinking to themselves, "Who is this man claiming to forgive sins because no one can do this but God alone," which is sort of precisely the point. They hear Jesus saying that he's forgiving this man in a way that only God can forgive, and they're troubled by this; they assume he's blaspheming. It means they've heard him correctly and they've responded to him wrongly. This is one impressive piece of evidence in the Gospels for the deity of Jesus. That in his own self-understanding, his own self-claim, is a claim to forgive sins, not just merely in removing relational offenses — presumably he's never seen this paralytic before — but to forgive sins in a way that actually cancels their objective guilt in the way that only God can. [Dr. Robert Lister]
> 

All sin is a transgression and offense against God, who is himself the ultimate standard of righteousness. Moreover, since God alone is the highest king and final judge, he is the only one who has authority to forgive these offenses against him. Only he has the authority to demonstrate mercy on this level. But since Jesus was God's perfectly righteous vassal King, God delegated to him the authority to grant forgiveness, so that Jesus could also apply God's mercy to his people.

The third way Jesus fulfilled the function of a king was by executing God's law in a way that promoted faithfulness to God.

### Faithfulness

As we did with justice and mercy, we'll consider Jesus' promotion of faithfulness in two parts, beginning with the international arena. The most direct way Jesus promoted heartfelt worship and obedience to God was by preaching the kingdom of God to the Gentile nations. We see this in Matthew 4:13-25, 24:14, Luke 24:47, and especially in Jesus' commissions to his disciples in Matthew 28:18-20 and Acts 1:8. In both of these commissions, Jesus commanded his followers to make disciples of all nations, and to be his witnesses to the ends of the earth.

And of course, Jesus also promoted faithfulness on a national level. As with his international work among the Gentiles, Jesus promoted faithfulness within the nation of Israel especially through his preaching of the gospel. As he went from town to town, he commanded the people to repent, to turn away from their sin and become loyal to God, because God's kingdom was at hand. Listen to the way Matthew summarized Jesus' preaching in Matthew 4:17:

> From that time on Jesus began to preach, "Repent, for the kingdom of heaven is near" (Matthew 4:17).
> 

We see similar summaries in Mark 1:15, and Luke 5:32 and 10:13. And we find examples of this kind of preaching in many places throughout the Gospels.

> Jesus placed such a strong emphasis on faithfulness to God. He did this because faithfulness is an expression of trust. It's an expression of realizing God really does deserve our faithfulness, our trust, our obedience, our devotion, above all else. When you disobey doctor's orders, you're not just saying something about the orders; you're saying something about the doctor. And when you disobey God, you're not just saying something about his commands that you're disregarding, you're saying something about the God who gave those commands. And so faithfulness is an expression of trust. It's an expression of seeing God for who he is, and then of course, doing what he says. So, faithfulness to God is an expression of obedience. It's an expression of daily devotion and trust in who he is. Paul in Romans talks about the Christian life in his apostolic ministry as one that should lead to the obedience of faith. It's a beautiful expression which in some ways summarizes the Christian life. We see God for who he is, we put our faith in him, and that naturally leads to obedience. We obey the God that we trust. [Dr. K. Erik Thoennes]

> Faithfulness is what Jesus offered to us as the joy of walking with him, knowing him intimately. But he also wants my responsiveness daily to him. He's not forcing me to obey him. He's not making me follow a law. He says, I need a faithful heart no matter what your emotions are today, no matter what you feel is going on in the world, badly or good, I need a faithful bride. I need a faithful servant, a faithful lover of my own heart. And that's what I think he was getting at with guys like me who tend to look at the world in terms of how I can define spirituality. The Lord says there's something much deeper than that. I want a faithful heart. Just like a married couple, that's the foundation of true love. Faithfulness no matter what comes down the road. So the Lord requires faithfulness, but he also enables faithfulness by his Holy Spirit's presence. [Dr. Bill Ury]

Having considered Jesus' royal qualifications and his function in the office of king, we're ready to see how he fulfilled the Old Testament expectations for the future messianic king.

## Expectations

Throughout Israel's history, the frailties and sinfulness of its kings prevented them from fulfilling their responsibilities before God. Even faithful leaders like Moses, Joshua and David, who submitted themselves to God's law and cared for his people, weren't able to do all that God required. At best, they provided peace and security for a short time. But the requirements of the law were too great for them to meet on a perpetual basis. The law is simply too difficult for any fallen human being to fulfill to God's satisfaction. Moreover, even the best leaders were limited by age and death. Problems like these are identified in several places in the Bible, including Zechariah 4:6, Acts 13:34-39, Hebrews 4:8, and Romans 8:3-4.

The kings that ruled God's people in the Old Testament never achieved God's greatest blessings for his people. They couldn't. They were frail, fallen human beings. But their failures created the hope that God would eventually honor his covenant with David by sending a righteous son of David to rescue his people. This king would be especially empowered by God's Spirit so that he wouldn't have the normal limits of human frailty. He would be the one that kept God's law perfectly as the redeemer for the past failures of the line of David, and of the nation of Israel, and of the human race. And this is exactly the kind of king God sent in Jesus. Through Jesus — the righteous son of David, the Messiah — God finally did for humanity what we couldn't do for ourselves.

We'll consider the way Jesus fulfilled these Old Testament expectations by focusing on four aspects of his kingship. First, we'll see that Jesus restored the Davidic dynasty. Second, we'll focus on the freedom and victory he gave to his people. Third, we'll consider the everlasting kingdom that Jesus brought. And fourth, we'll focus on the worldwide nature of that kingdom. Let's begin with the fact that Jesus restored the Davidic dynasty.

### Davidic Dynasty

On many occasions in the New Testament, Jesus is specifically identified as the prophesied son of David who restores David's dynasty. Inspired writers drew this connection in passages like Matthew 1:1, Luke 3:31, and Romans 1:3. The Apostle Paul proclaimed it in Acts 13:22-23. And Jesus himself claimed to be the messianic son of David in Matthew 21:15-16, and Revelation 3:7 and 22:16. This evidence demonstrates that Jesus really was the prophesied son of David, the future messianic king that would fulfill God's kingdom purposes for all creation.

As the heir to David's throne, Jesus began to fulfill God's kingdom purposes first by restoring a faithful remnant within national Israel, namely, his faithful apostles and disciples. Then, as Jesus commanded in Matthew 28:19-20, these followers expanded their ranks by evangelizing and discipling both Jews and Gentiles in every nation they could reach. And their disciples moved even further into the world making still more disciples. This process has continued ever since, with the result that God's earthly kingdom now includes a huge percentage of the world's population, and is present to some degree in nearly every tribe and country on earth.

Jesus also met Old Testament expectations by giving freedom and victory to those who were faithful to him.

### Freedom and Victory

During his life on earth, Jesus acted decisively to give his people freedom through victory over their spiritual enemies, such as sin, death, and demons. Listen to these words from Matthew 1:21-23:

> [The angel of the Lord said to Joseph,] "She will give birth to a son, and you are to give him the name Jesus, because he will save his people from their sins." All this took place to fulfill what the Lord had said through the prophet: "The virgin will be with child and will give birth to a son, and they will call him Immanuel" — which means, "God with us" (Matthew 1:21-23).
> 

In this passage, Matthew compared Jesus' birth to the Immanuel child mentioned in Isaiah 7:14.

In the context of Isaiah's prophecy, the Immanuel child was a sign that God was the warrior king that was with his people in battle. He would fight for them and defeat their enemies, bringing them freedom from oppression through victory in war. And this is what made Jesus so special. He was the prophesied king God would use to fight and defeat the greatest enemy of all: sin. We see this same theme in John 8:36, where Jesus said that only he could give true freedom from sin.

Jesus also gave his people victory over death. Paul talked about this in Romans 6:4-9, and 1 Corinthians 15:54-57, where he assured us that Jesus' resurrection defeated both sin and death on our behalf. Now, in some sense, sin and death are still problems for us, since we still sin and our bodies still die. But we already have victory over these enemies because they no longer have the power to control and condemn us.

And something similar is true of the demons. As our great King, Jesus has defeated them, and given us the victory. They still trouble and tempt us. And they can even harm us physically. But they have no power to hold us in bondage or to damage our souls. Listen to how Paul described Jesus' victory over the demons in Colossians 2:15:

> Having disarmed the powers and authorities, he made a public spectacle of them, triumphing over them by the cross (Colossians 2:15).
> 

When Jesus returns, he will completely defeat every enemy that opposes him and his people. But even now, he has executed preliminary judgment against those that would do us the most harm, in order to secure our freedom from their mastery.

The third Old Testament expectation of kings that Jesus fulfilled was that he established an everlasting kingdom.

### Everlasting Kingdom

The Old Testament foretold that the promised king would usher in a kingdom that would exist forever. It would be heaven on earth, and it would endure for all time under its Davidic king. And the New Testament affirms that Jesus' rule as king will last forever in passages like Matthew 19:28-29 and 25:34, Luke 1:33, and Hebrews 1:8-13. But where is this kingdom now? Did Jesus really fulfill this expectation? Or are we still waiting for him to do it?

> One of the things that Jesus accomplished during his earthly ministry was to establish the kingdom of God on earth. Now, what that appears to mean is that, in an act of divine power, Jesus established a beachhead in hostile territory, and inaugurated an invasion initiative that is destined to restore this planet to its rightful creator and owner and king. This initial assault on hostile territory manifested itself in a number of dramatic ways: challenging systemic evil, challenging demonic evil, dispelling deception with light and truth. It was a powerful introduction of an alternative allegiance. This campaign is still underway. There remains mopping up operations, cleaning up, last holdouts to be eliminated. And the final enemy that remains to be overcome is death. And so, even as we participate in the power of the Spirit in this ongoing kingdom campaign we pray, "your kingdom come, your will be done." There's still something we need supernatural aid to see achieved. [Dr. Glen Scorgie]
> 

> In fulfillment of Old Testament expectation, God's saving rule has broken into this world in Jesus Christ, culminating in his death, his resurrection, his resurrection demonstrating that his death has been victorious. Sin has been dealt with. Death as the consequence of sin has been defeated. And not just in the resurrection. His glorious ascension — he is now seated at God's right hand. Pentecost — he has poured out the Spirit. All of that is part of the coming of the kingdom. The, what we call, the "inauguration of the kingdom," it is now here. Yet, our Lord Jesus Christ has also told us that there is still the future. We still pray. Think of the Lord's Prayer, that we pray, "Your kingdom come." Well, the kingdom has come. He has won victory. It is still awaiting its consummation. [Dr. Stephen Wellum]
> 

> One of the most difficult things for people to understand, especially Jewish people, to understand, is the relationship between the first and second coming of Jesus the Messiah. It's understandable that people would say, well, how could Jesus be the Messiah and have fulfilled messianic expectations when we don't see lions lying down with lambs. We don't see people beating their swords into plowshares. We don't see peace on earth, good will toward men. So how is it that the Messiah has come? What we call it is inaugurated eschatology. This idea that end-time realities have been brought into history with the first coming of Jesus. They've been inaugurated, they've been initiated and begun in a decisive way, but they still are being worked out to the point where there will ultimately be a consummation of these realities. It's been called "the now and not yet" of the kingdom. That the kingdom has come, Jesus has brought it. He's delivered the decisive blow in the battle. But the battle still rages and it awaits a future, ultimate fulfillment in coming. [Dr. K. Erik Thoennes]
> 

Jesus clearly established his messianic kingdom before he ascended to his throne in heaven. We see this in passages like Matthew 12:28, where Jesus said that his power to exorcise demons proved that he had already brought the kingdom of God. Exorcism was not a sign that the kingdom was on its way. Instead, it was proof that the kingdom was already present in power, and that its king was casting down his enemies. And while some scholars object that the kingdom didn't come in the visible way many expected, Jesus insisted that it was a mistake to look for its physical manifestations in the sense of traditional political power. As he told the Pharisees in Luke 17:20-21:

> The kingdom of God does not come with your careful observation, nor will people say, "Here it is," or "There it is," because the kingdom of God is within you" (Luke 17:20-21).
> 

Finally, the fourth Old Testament expectation for the Davidic king that Jesus fulfilled was that he established a worldwide kingdom.

### Worldwide Kingdom

When Jesus returns, the entire new earth will be part of his kingdom. And his physical power and rule will replace all earthly governments. For now, his universal reign is primarily spiritual, as we see in Ephesians 1:21-22. But when he returns, it will also be physical. Revelation 21–22 paint a glorious picture of the new heavens and earth, where Jesus reigns as king from his capital in the New Jerusalem.

The New Testament makes it clear that Jesus really is the long-awaited messianic King, the son of David who came to bring God's kingdom to earth. He didn't fulfill all the Old Testament prophecies and expectations during his earthly ministry. But he fulfilled so many of them that he proved he is the true King, and he has assured us that he will come again to finish what he started. On that day, his kingdom will perfectly fulfill God's original purposes for creation. The entire world will be God's earthly kingdom, free from sin and suffering, secure in peace and prosperity, and blessed by the fellowship and presence of God.

So far in our lesson on Jesus the King, we've explored the Old Testament background to Jesus' kingly office and the fulfillment of this office in Christ. So, now we're ready to turn to our last major topic: the modern application of Jesus' role as king.

# MODERN APPLICATION

While there are many ways to describe the modern implications of Jesus' kingship, one helpful model can be found in Question and Answer 26 of the Westminster Shorter Catechism. In answer to the question,

> Q. How does Jesus execute the office of a king?
> 

The catechism answers,

> A. Christ executeth the office of a king, in subduing us to himself, in ruling and defending us, and in restraining and conquering all his and our enemies.
> 

This answer describes the ways Jesus' kingship impacts our lives in terms of three traditional categories from systematic theology. First, Jesus subdues us to himself, that is, he brings us into his kingdom, so that we are no longer his enemies but his beloved citizens. Second, he governs his kingdom by ruling and defending us. And third, he restrains and ultimately conquers all his and our enemies.

Following the emphasis of the Westminster Shorter Catechism, we'll discuss the modern application of Jesus' office of king in three parts: First, we'll see that Jesus builds his kingdom. Second, we'll consider the fact that he governs his people. And third, we'll focus on the way he conquers his enemies. Let's look first at how Jesus builds his kingdom.

## Builds His Kingdom

We'll consider how Jesus builds his kingdom from three perspectives: first, the goal of his work; second, the manifestation of his kingdom in the world; and third, the methods Jesus is using to build his kingdom. Let's begin with the goal of Jesus' work.

### Goal

Scripture teaches that God plans to turn the entire world into his earthly kingdom, so that his rule on earth reflects his rule in heaven. We see this in places like Matthew 6:10, where Jesus taught us to pray that God's kingdom would come, and that his will would be done on earth in the same way that it is already done in heaven. And we see it in the picture of the new heaven and new earth described in Revelation 21–22. So, broadly speaking, the goal of Jesus' kingdom building is to turn the world into God's earthly kingdom, fit for him to inhabit, and full of people who are completely loyal to him.

But if the goal is for God to have an earthly kingdom, what role does Jesus play? Well, even though God is the supreme King over all creation, he has appointed Jesus to rule it in a more direct fashion, so that God's kingdom is also rightly called Jesus' kingdom. In this regard, God is like an ancient Near-Eastern suzerain, and Jesus is his vassal king. And because Jesus wants to please his suzerain, he has dedicated himself to accomplishing God's goal. Listen to how Paul described Jesus' submission to God the Father in 1 Corinthians 15:24, 28:

> Then the end will come, when [Christ] hands over the kingdom to God the Father after he has destroyed all dominion, authority and power… When he has done this, then the Son himself will be made subject to him who put everything under him, so that God may be all in all (1 Corinthians 15:24, 28).
> 

As God's supreme vassal king, Jesus has authority over God's kingdom, and even over creation. And he is using that authority to conquer everything that opposes God, and to subject everything to God, in order to accomplish God's purposes for his creation.

But what does this goal mean for us? How should modern Christians respond to the idea that Jesus' goal is to turn the entire world into God's kingdom? Well, the simple answer is that we should make God's kingdom the main goal for our lives, too. Whatever other goals we have — making a living, providing for our families, staying healthy, getting an education — they should all be pursued in ways that further the kingdom of God. As Jesus taught in Matthew 6:33:

> Seek first [God's] kingdom and his righteousness, and all these things will be given to you as well (Matthew 6:33).
> 

The second aspect of the way Jesus builds his kingdom we'll mention is the kingdom's manifestation in the world.

### Manifestation

Many theologians throughout the ages have noticed that when the New Testament talks about the present manifestation of Jesus' kingdom, it often associates the kingdom with the church. The relationship between the kingdom and the church is described in many places throughout Scripture, including passages like Ephesians 1:19–2:20; and Revelation 1:4-6. As just one example, listen to this discussion between Peter and Jesus in Matthew 16:16-19:

> Simon Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Jesus replied, "Blessed are you, Simon son of Jonah, for this was not revealed to you by man, but by my Father in heaven. And I tell you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not overcome it. I will give you the keys of the kingdom of heaven; whatever you bind on earth will be bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on earth will be loosed in heaven" (Matthew 16:16-19).
> 

This passage says at least three things that closely associate the kingdom with the church. First, Jesus said, "I will build my church." And then he followed this statement by saying that he would give Peter "the keys of the kingdom of heaven." Notice the connection here: Peter, an apostle and part of the foundation of the *church*, would have power over the "kingdom" of heaven.

A second detail that highlights the relationship between the kingdom and the church is the fact that Peter applied the title Christ to Jesus. The word "Christ" means "anointed one." It was a specific reference to the fact that kings were anointed with oil to mark their claim to the throne. So, by calling Jesus "Christ," Peter was identifying Jesus as the prophesied Davidic King. And it was in his role as king that Jesus was going to build a church.

And a third detail in Matthew 16:16-19 that points to a close connection between the kingdom and the church is that Jesus intended the church to participate in the warfare between Hades or "hell" and the kingdom of heaven.

These details all point to the fact that both Jesus and Peter thought of the church and the kingdom as very closely related concepts. But as closely related as the church and kingdom are, they're not precisely identical in the New Testament. The majority of scholars agree that the kingdom is a much larger concept than the church.

> The relationship between the church and the kingdom of God is a very interesting one. The kingdom of God is the macro-vision of the restoration of all things to a willing submission to the perfect will of God. A vision that is all encompassing for the entire universe, certainly this planet and human life. It's a submission to the king that will create an incredible shalom of life as it was intended for God's glory and our great joy. The church is one of the principal instruments God has chosen for the advance of this macro-vision. It's important not to equate the church, and certainly not religious ecclesiastical structures, with the kingdom; they are not one in the same, but the one is a means to the end. And also, the church should, as a city set on a hill, so to speak, already be manifesting in its own interior life and social dynamics, the very dynamics that will one day characterize God's entire creation from sea to sea. We are to be the prototype of the kingdom as well as agents of the kingdom [Dr. Glen Scorgie]
> 

> Both the concepts of the kingdom of God and the church are indispensable for a full Christian understanding of how we are to live in any part of our lives. But I think it's important for there to be a distinction between the two. I think many Christians, including me for years, thought well, the church is sort of like the climax of the kingdom, so we're kind of the most important thing going. But the kingdom concept in all of Scripture is much larger than the church. So the way I view, and I think the Bible does too, views the church as an irreplaceable part of the kingdom, but it's a sub part or a piece of the kingdom work. God's kingdom, his rulership, has always been the base of reality. He is the reigning Lord of the universe, of all creation, of us. He is Lord of all peoples, all nations, all kings, all tribes. Now most don't know that, but he is. So the kingdom of God, the reign of God, is an overarching theme in all of Scripture. The church, hopefully, are those people who have submitted to the lordship of Jesus, recognize his sovereign lordship and have submitted themselves to being his agents in the world. [Dr. Bill Ury]
> 

The New Testament teaches that the final glorious stage of God's reign over creation began at Christ's first coming. Since that time God's kingdom on earth has continued to grow and to bring many facets of human culture under submission to God. And when Christ returns, God's kingdom will be entirely unopposed and thoroughly manifested throughout every aspect of nature and human culture.

But how does the church fit into that outline of history? Essentially, the church is the core of God's kingdom on earth in the present age. We devote ourselves to furthering the kingdom of God now. And when Christ returns, we'll inherit the full blessings of the kingdom. Until that time, we spread the gospel of Christ by teaching everything he commanded, in order to extend God's manifest reign into every dimension of human society, to the greatest degree possible, prior to the return of Christ.

> It's very important that the church understand its place in the kingdom. When we are going to be with him in the future, when he comes again, I don't think we're going to be referred to as the church. I think that will be the kingdom. The bride will be produced for her bridegroom, that other very important picture in Scripture. So why I'm saying it this way, I think that sometimes we as a church have too high a view of ourselves. We think we're the only answer, or God's only purpose. And we're very, very important. He died for the church. He died to offer himself. But he also died for the world. So the best way for me to view myself as a member of the church of Jesus Christ is to say, I've got one goal and that's to be the body of Christ. I am called to be his hands, his feet, his arms to the world just like he would be if he were here. That's my king's command to me and to us as the church. The sad thing is I think sometimes the church says, "Well, we're the climax of the kingdom, therefore we're the end of what he's come to do and therefore we are going to sit and do nothing or just enjoy his presence until he comes again." I think that's a wrong view and we need to correct ourselves and get back into the business of connecting the church's purpose with the kingly purposes of our Lord and Savior. [Dr. Bill Ury]
> 

Now that we've considered the goal for which Jesus builds his kingdom, and the manifestation of his kingdom, we should turn to the methods Jesus uses to build his kingdom.

### Methods

Jesus' builds his kingdom in two primary ways, both of which directly involve the church: he adds more *people* to the church, and he expands its *geographical borders*. In the New Testament, Jesus began gathering people primarily from Israel. But at his ascension he instructed the church to expand his kingdom from Judea, to Samaria, to the ends of the earth, as we read in Acts 1:6-8. Jesus is building his kingdom by expanding the church to include the entire human race and cover the whole world.

But how do we, the church, respond to and participate in this work? In general terms, the answer is found in these words from the Great Commission in Matthew 28:19-20:

> Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, and teaching them to obey everything I have commanded you (Matthew 28:19-20).
> 

As we can see here, the primary methods Jesus uses to build his kingdom are evangelism, baptism and biblical teaching. And rather than carrying out these methods single-handedly, Jesus has assigned the church to perform them on his behalf. Evangelism brings people to faith. Baptism joins them to the church. And teaching helps them grow in ways that strengthen the church and lead to its further expansion.

> The challenge at the end of the Gospels is that we should go into all nations, proclaiming the good news and making disciples. The language of discipleship implies more than just being a learner. It implies more than just being a believer. But it also implies being in a relationship with God. Yes, the God who will teach us. Yes, the God who will lead us, but the challenge to make disciples is to have people who will be in a lifetime's apprenticeship, relationship, with God. And, therefore that needs to be well-modeled, so I think that people need to be in relationship with other believers who can show them how to live the Christian life well. It needs, obviously, teaching as well. People need to understand God's requirements of his followers and his disciples. But I think also it needs to be embedded in the church because it is there that God has put in place the structures for people to grow as Christians and indeed to be lifelong learners, to use that phrase, those who are in relationship with God and following him faithfully. [Dr. Simon Vibert]
> 

Having looked at the modern applications of the idea that Jesus builds his kingdom, let's turn to the fact that he governs his people within that kingdom.

## Governs His People

We'll consider two aspects of the way Jesus governs his people. First, we'll focus on the fact that he rules them for their good. And second, we'll see that he defends them from their enemies. Let's look first at how Jesus rules his people.

### Rules

Jesus' rule is focused on securing our eternal good, those blessings that we will enjoy with him forever. Everyone that comes to him receives mercy and pardon, as we see in passages like John 6:35-37, 7:37, and 10:28-29; and Acts 5:31. He adopts us as heirs of God, and shares with us all the covenant blessings he has earned through his perfect obedience. We read about these aspects of Jesus' rule in Acts 13:34-39; Romans 8:17, 32; and Hebrews 2:13. Moreover, he grants us all these blessings as a gift of grace, as we read in John 1:16, Ephesians 2:8-9, and many other places.

Christ's loving rule also provides us with temporal good in the present world. He gives us his presence through the Holy Spirit, as we see in Acts 2:33, Galatians 4:6, and Philippians 1:19. He gives us clear direction in the Bible, so that we can serve him faithfully, as we see in 1 Corinthians 9:21, Galatians 6:2, and Colossians 3:16. And he appoints leadership for the church, delegating to them authority and power to minister to his people, as we read in 1 Corinthians 12:28, and Ephesians 4:11-12.

King Jesus is not a harsh dictator; he is a loving king that cares and provides for us. Far from being a source of trouble, his rule is a benevolent blessing that benefits us both now and forever. And our response to this rule should be obvious. In order to receive the blessings our king has for us, we need to submit to his rule. We should be obedient to his law and trust in his mercy and power to overcome our failures and difficulties. And, of course, we should be thankful for his leadership, and praise him for his goodness to us.

Now that we've talked about the implications of the fact that Jesus rules his people, let's turn to the idea that he also defends us.

### Defends

There are many ways that Jesus defends believers, but for our purposes in this lesson we'll focus on just three. First, Jesus defends us against the temptation to sin.

As our king, Jesus defends us against temptation in many ways. For example, he warns us of temptations ahead of time, as we read in Matthew 6:13. He strengthens us to resist sin, as we read in Hebrews 2:16. And he protects us from situations that would overwhelm us or trap us, always making sure that we have a way to avoid sin, as we see in 1 Corinthians 10:13 and 2 Timothy 4:18.

Second, when we do give in to temptation, Jesus defends us from the corruption of sin. One way Jesus defends us against corruption is by disciplining and correcting us when we sin, so that we don't subject ourselves to sin's mastery. We see this in Jeremiah 46:28, Hebrews 12:5-11, Revelation 3:19, and many other passages. And another way he defends us against corruption is by granting us forgiveness and cleansing from sin when we repent, as we see in 1 John 1:9.

Third, Jesus defends us against accusations of sin. All Christians are prone to sin. And when we do, Satan tries to persuade God to condemn us, as we read in places like Revelation 12:10. But Jesus defends us against these accusations, so that God counts us as perfectly righteous. Although Scripture often speaks of Christ's intercession for us in terms of his priestly office, Romans 8:34 indicates that it's also an aspect of his kingship. As the great vassal king, Jesus defends his people against accusations by interceding for us with the great suzerain.

Because Jesus defends us so strongly, we can have great confidence in our battles with sin. If we rely on his strength to resist temptation, and on his forgiveness to cleanse us from sin's effects, and on his advocacy to protect us from sin's consequences, nothing can harm us. Jesus is the great and powerful warrior king that leads us into battle against sin. And even if we don't fight well, we still can't lose — because he won't let us. He will always preserve and protect us, forgive and cleanse us, defend and acquit us. And eventually, he'll bring us into the unfailing blessings of his eternal kingdom.

Now that we've looked at the ways Jesus governs his people, we're ready to turn to the fact that he also conquers his enemies.

## Conquers His Enemies

When God's law is violated, many people are often hurt. We see this every day when crimes are committed. There are victims who have been robbed, or swindled, or beaten, or betrayed, or even killed. And in the language of Scripture, the criminals that commit these crimes have made themselves the enemies of both their victims and God. And the proper response of the government is to catch and punish these criminals. Their judgment is supposed to be both an appropriate penalty for their crimes, and a way to protect their victims and the rest of society from further crimes. Scripture speaks of this in places like Proverbs 20:8 and 25:5.

And something similar is true of the judgment that Jesus brings. He punishes his and our enemies according to justice, in order to exact retribution for their crimes. But he also punishes them as an act of blessing and benevolence toward us, in order to protect us from their sin and violence, and to purify and protect the world he is making for us. This is why the judgment and destruction of sinners is a critical part of Jesus' mission of turning the world into God's earthly kingdom. In order for the world to be pleasing to God and fit for him to inhabit, and in order for us to enjoy its everlasting blessings, the corruption of sin must be completely removed from it.

As we saw earlier in this lesson, Jesus began executing judgment against many of his and our enemies during his earthly ministry. These enemies included sin, death and the demons. Jesus' victory over these enemies is secure, but he hasn't finished punishing them yet. So, in the present age, Jesus continues to execute judgment against them, and he will complete their judgment only when he returns. This fact is taught in 2 Peter 2:4; Jude verse 6; and Revelation 20:10, 14.

But Jesus and his church also have other enemies. Every sinner who hasn't submitted himself to Christ is a citizen of the kingdom of Satan and an enemy of God. Scripture makes this clear in Matthew 13:37-43; Luke 19:27; and Ephesians 2:1-3.

At the present time, Jesus executes partial judgment against some of these enemies during their earthly lives, as when Herod was struck dead in Acts 12:23 because he allowed the people to treat him as a god. But for the most part, Jesus forbears in his judgment against his enemies, patiently withholding his judgment until he returns.

> It's very interesting that future judgment is often expressed as part of the gospel as presented in the New Testament. This may seem like a curious element of what would otherwise be good news. But the truth is that this is part of the good news. And the reason it's part of the Good News, is it's God's assurance that just as suffering will not endure forever, but be addressed with healing, injustice will not be permitted to continue indefinitely, but wrong will be made right. There is something of a deep longing in every human heart that injustice will not prevail, or be dismissed as unimportant because we are moving on. This is God's assuring promise to those who suffer that this will not be tolerated. They have an advocate, and that they do not need to go out with some sort of revengeful vigilante justice and take it into their own hands but to entrust themselves to a faithful judge who will do right. [Dr. Glen Scorgie]

The apostles were clear that Jesus' rule as king would include a future day of judgment, when everyone would answer to his rule and his law. This judgment on the last day is mentioned in places like Acts 17:31, Romans 14:10-12, and Hebrews 10:26-31. The coming Day of Judgment is a central part of Christ's work as king because it will satisfy his justice toward sinners, his mercy toward believers, and his faithfulness to the Father as he purifies his kingdom.

Although the doctrine of the last judgment can be terrifying for those who haven't received Christ as Lord, this isn't a bad thing. These warnings provide an opportunity for the unfaithful to repent of their sin, and to receive forgiveness, mercy and grace from our king Jesus Christ. Yes, they're strongly worded. But at their core, they're offers of blessing to those who repent. In fact, this is why gospel presentations in the Bible often contain a warning of future judgment. For example, we see this in Matthew 21:32-44 and Acts 17:30-31.

> I think many Christians are perplexed sometimes by the description and presentation of the Gospel in Scripture, which also includes a very clear message about the devastating eternal punishment of the unrepentant, those who are not in Christ, those who die in their sins. You know, I think I understood a little bit better when I had a doctor look me in the face and say, "We found a tumor in you." Now, that doesn't sound like good news, but you know, it really was good news. It was good news that he found it. It was good news that he told me about it. What if he thought it wasn't nice to tell me I had a tumor in me? Well, that wouldn't be loving; that wouldn't be gracious. That wouldn't be good. He found that tumor, and he told me, "Here's the reality. You've got a tumor, and it'll kill you. But we can do something about it." So, there's the good news. You know, the Scripture presents so clearly the judgment that is to come and the consequences of sin. That's good news that we know that. It's good news also because it displays the glory of God. We're not told that there's a judgment coming and, by the way, this is something God just can't prevent from happening. We're told that this is the outpouring of God's righteousness and his justice, his holiness. So, it's good that we know that in order that we would flee to Christ in order to avoid the destruction that is to come, the judgment that is to come. But, you know, the Bible also is very honest when you come to the closing chapters of the New Testament in the book of Revelation that the glory of God is in the salvation of the redeemed and in the judgment that is poured out upon the unrepentant. Now, when we look at that, we have to recognize that God's glory is most quintessentially, infinitely seen when he displays his righteousness, both to those who are in Christ and have their sins forgiven in Christ by no merit of their own, and to those who, to the end, obstinately refused him. You know, the reality is that we need to know this. The gospel is good news first of all because it tells us how we can flee the destruction that is to come, how we can trust Christ and be found in him and find everlasting life. But it's also good news because we need to know the rest of the story. That's part of the gospel too. [Dr. R. Albert Mohler, Jr.]
> 

The Bible's teaching about the last judgment should actually be very encouraging for believers. It assures us that our suffering is not in vain. Every wrong will be set right, as we read in James 5:7-8, and 2 Thessalonians 1:4-10. Christ's judgment is reason for praise, because it will destroy the presence, corruption and influence of every form of evil, and result in the purged and perfect world that we will inherit and inhabit forever. As the angel proclaimed in Revelation 14:7:

> Fear God and give him glory, because the hour of his judgment has come. Worship him who made the heavens, the earth, the sea and the springs of water (Revelation 14:7).

# CONCLUSION

In this lesson, we've explored Jesus' office of king. We've considered the Old Testament background of his office in terms of its qualifications and functions, and the expectations for its future. We've also seen the fulfillment of each of these aspects of the office of king in Jesus. And we've explored the modern application of Jesus' kingship in terms of the way Jesus builds his kingdom, governs his people and conquers his enemies.

In this series, we've surveyed the riches of the doctrine of Christ. We've seen Jesus as the redeemer throughout all history; we've considered his life and ministry; and we've explored his offices as prophet, priest and king. Our knowledge of Jesus, however, should never be purely academic. But when we grasp who he is, and comprehend what he has revealed about himself, we will then love and follow him throughout our lives, in all that we do, in our homes, our work, our churches.

一、介绍

人类的历史常是按着有权势的君王在位统治的年代来写的。我们都听过那些曾经统管过亚洲、欧洲、非洲和拉丁美洲各地的君王大名，他们当中有些人征服了许多仇敌，以致他们的帝国似乎延伸到天涯海角。然而他们至少有个共同点：他们都已经离世，不再辉煌，他们不再统领自己的帝国；他们精壮的军队消失的无影无踪，他们的权势也如烟消云散。

在人类历史上，这个情况只出现过一个例外。只有一位君王，他的权能从未消退过，他的国度将永不终结。当然，这位君王就是耶稣基督。

这是我们相信耶稣这个系列课程的第五课，题目是君王。在这一课里，我们会查考耶稣如何以 上帝忠实的仆人与儿子的身份来治理，履行旧约的君王职份。在前面几课我们已经看过，在旧约历史的不同阶段，上帝设立了三个职份，以此来治理祂的国度，那就是先知、祭司和君王。在上帝国度的最后阶段，也就是通称的新约时代，这三个职份最终落实在耶稣身上。在这一课里，我们要专注探讨的是耶稣的君王职份。

为了本课的目的，我们对于君王的定义是他是上帝所确立的一个人，代表上帝来治理祂的国度。按着这个定义而言，上帝从过去到未来永远是万有的最高掌管者；但是上帝也会任命一些人承担摄政的职务。这些人类的君王是臣服于上帝，要促进并达成 上帝国度的目标。我们记住这个定义，对于《圣经》里君王的职份，和耶稣如何履行这个职份，就能有更清楚的理解。

如同前两课，耶稣为先知和耶稣为祭司，所采用的讨论格式一样，这一课我们首先要查考君王职份的旧约背景。其次我们要探讨君王职份在耶稣里全然实现。第三，我们要思考耶稣的君王职份在我们生活中的现今应用。让我们先来看耶稣君王职份的旧约背景。


二、旧约背景

希腊的哲学家柏拉图在他那本共和国的著作里，认为一个国家如果由一个哲学家国王来治理的话，可能会是个最好的政府，按他的观点，那样的君王不会贪爱钱财或是权势，而是喜爱智慧，会让国家得着许多的福祉。同样的，《圣经》也显示，当以色列的君王敬畏 上帝，遵守祂的律法典章时，他们的国家在上帝的祝福之下就非常昌盛；而若是他们反其道而行，背逆上帝，全国的百姓就会因着上帝的审判而受苦。由此看来，以色列君王的作为关系着 上帝在地上国度的兴衰或是安宁与否。

我们要以三个要点来探讨君王职份的旧约背景。第一，君王的资格；第二，君王的职责；第三，旧约对于以色列王权未来的期盼。我们先从君王职份的资格谈起。


资格

在旧约里， 上帝在两个时代启示担任君王的资格，首先是在摩西律法里，那时以色列还没有君王，可是 上帝已经启示君王职份的准则。其次，在君王政体确立之后，上帝在大卫之约里又附加了一个重要的资格。让我们先来看摩西律法里所列的，担任君王的一些准则。


摩西律法

<div class = "quote">
很有意思的是，你读旧约《圣经》，特别是前五卷书，摩西五经的时候，在那里你已经看到《圣经》预告了一位君王要到来。在君王出现很久之前，你已经看到《圣经》讲君王应该是怎样的，应该做什么。为什么会是这样？我想我们需要把这种经文，特别是预告君王要来，君王要做什么的申命记17章，放在上帝计划的光照下来看。你其实需要回到亚当那里。亚当发挥一种先知、祭司和君王的作用。他对这地的管理，这种统治和王权，在某种意义上已经失去了。以色列民通过亚伯拉罕之约又重新得到这些。即使在创世记17章，那里已经有应许，通过亚伯拉罕的族谱，君王将要临到。这一点在以色列那独特的君王身上开始应验。旧约《圣经》中的君王，虽然在很久很久以前，比如说在在申命记17章，已经由摩西宣告出来，却是在预备我们面对罪对这个世界的影响，通过君王，大卫家的君王来复兴的，而且比这更多的是，主耶稣基督的来到，他担任这些职责，成全了大卫的职责，成全了以色列的职责，最终成全了亚当的职责，把我们恢复到我们被造应该有的样子，所有这一切都已经被预告出来。所有这一切都预备我们，在上帝的计划展开时更明白他的计划，带领我们去看到弥赛亚的主题，就是「这是那将要发生的，这是那一位要出现的，那位君王就是要这样成全这些职责。」我认为这是为什么摩西在以色列有君王前就给了我们这些预备。（司提反•威乐姆博士)
</div>

在摩西预备以色列的国民要进入并且征服应许之地的时候，他向百姓解释，上帝至终会任命一个君王来治理他们，他并且列出四个原则，用来指引上帝所任命的君王。申命记17章14到19节，摩西这么写着：

<div class = "quote">
你……得了那地居住的时候……你总要立耶和华─你上帝所拣选的人为王。必从你弟兄中立一人；……只是王不可为自己加添马匹，也不可使百姓回埃及去，为要加添他的马匹……他也不可为自己多立妃嫔……也不可为自己多积金银。.他……要将……这律法书，为自己抄录一本……要平生诵读，好学习敬畏耶和华─他的上帝，谨守遵行这律法书上的一切言语和这些律例。（申命记17章14-19节）
</div>

摩西列出与君王职份有关的四个原则。第一，他说以色列的王必须是蒙上帝所拣选的。人民没有资格能选举一个君王，他会按着上帝所要求的那样来带领他们；而且人民也没有权力把上帝的权限赋予某个人。只有上帝能够分授祂的权柄，而且祂也只会把权柄交给祂所拣选的人。

申命记17章，摩西提到的第二个原则是，君王必须是以色列人，也就是说，他必须是在 上帝所拣选的这个国家出生的国民，这是要应验创世记17章1到8节，上帝对亚伯拉罕的应许，那时 上帝应允说亚伯拉罕的后裔要成为他们民众的君王。

申命记17章提到的第三个资格是君王必须倚靠上帝，而不是人为的谋略，来求得国家的和平昌盛。摩西列出君王必须在四个方面倚靠 上帝。

<ol>
<li>虽然要使国家坚固稳定，需要组成强大的军队，马匹很重要；但是君王不准拥有太多的马匹，因为他们应该倚靠 上帝的能力，而不是人为的力量。</li>
<li>不可回返埃及，指的是他们必须只能顺服上帝，不能为了寻求保护和支援，而臣服于一个强大的帝国。</li>
<li>不准君王娶太多的妻妾，可能特别是讲到他们不该借着婚娶而达成政治联盟；这不单是会使以色列君王不倚靠上帝而去依赖外国的势力，而且那些外国的妻妾通常是拜偶像假神，也会引诱君王跟着那么作。</li>
<li>不准君王聚敛大量的金银，可能指的是不公义的税收。君王富有没什么不对，但若是借着压迫百姓而致富，就是犯罪了。</li>
</ol>

整体而言，这些限制是为了确保君王在治理国家，使其稳定强盛上，要全然的倚靠 上帝。

摩西在申命记17章强调的第四个原则是，君王必须显示忠于上帝的圣约，他要为自己抄录一本律法书，时常默想上帝的律法，这些行为是要君王培养敬畏上帝的心态，谦卑而谨守遵从 上帝的法则。

<div class = "quote">
以色列的君王和犹大的君王是在上帝面前代表百姓，所以在很多方面他们在其中有一种圣礼的功能，既是 上帝在地上的代表，也是在上帝面前代表百姓。所以他们处在这种特别的双向状态上具有重大的意义，上帝怎样回应君王，然后往往最终作为对整体国民的回应。我想你在以色列国和犹大国的整个历史当中看到这一点。以色列国中没有好王，他们都是坏王。然后他们首先在公元前722年陷落。但是，在犹大国中，你看到一种交替出现，看到有一位好王，在耶和华眼前行为正的事，然后是一位坏王，在耶和华眼前行恶，从这些交往里就出现了重大的影响。就在这方面，上帝审判，上帝先向君王发出来其「有罪」判决，然后也向百姓们发出。看起来君王的状态和百姓对他的跟从之间有着一种有机的联系。如果君王设立丘坛，向外邦的神献祭，百姓往往也做同样的事。反过来，也是一样，出现改革归正的时候，比如我们看到的约西亚王的改革，就给全国带来巨大的冲击，影响到百姓对上帝和上帝律法的回应方式。所以君王起着一个主要作用，在上帝面前代表百姓，在百姓面前代表上帝。（马可•伽格尼廉特博士）
</div>

我们查考了摩西所显示的作君王的资格以后，现在要来思考上帝与大卫立约时，所添加的另一个资格。


与大卫立约

撒母耳记下7章8到16节， 上帝和大卫订了一个圣约，诗篇89篇和132篇也提到这个约里的一些条款。这个约是确立大卫的后裔要永远治理以色列。 上帝对大卫和以色列显出极大的恩慈，不单确保大卫的后裔要长久治理，而且以色列国也会享有昌盛稳定。撒母耳记下7章8到16节， 上帝在这个圣约里如此应许：

<div class = "quote">
我从羊圈中将你召来，叫你不再跟从羊群，立你作我民以色列的君……我必使你得大名……我必为我民以色列选定一个地方……我必使你安靖，不被一切仇敌扰乱……我必使你的后裔接续你的位；我也必坚定他的国……你的家和你的国必在我面前永远坚立。你的国位也必坚定，直到永远。（撒母耳记下7章8-16节）
</div>

根据这个大卫之约， 上帝为以色列君王立了一个新的资格，就是从那时起，大卫的子孙要带领 上帝的百姓，只有大卫的家室才是正统的，能恒久的治理整个国家。

早在创世记中， 上帝赐福犹大支派拥有王权。雅各在创世记49章中预言说，「圭必不离犹大。」 因为大卫是来自犹大支派， 上帝对大卫的应许其实就是应验了创世记的祝福。 上帝一直计划在以色列人中设立一个来自犹大支派的君王，因为大卫对 上帝的顺服与信靠， 上帝就应许说，以色列的君王将永远来自大卫的子孙。没有人能够合法的宣称自己是以色列的君王，除非他来自大卫家族。这是为何对于福音书的作者来说是如此重要，要证实耶稣不光蒙 上帝的呼召，他还必须是来自大卫的直系后代，以致他能够合法继承大卫的宝座。

我们已经探讨了君王的资格，现在要来看本课的第二个主题，旧约君王的职责。


职责

在旧约里，以色列的君王主要是执行 上帝的律法，忠实的治理 上帝的百姓。如同我们前几课所看到的，在古代近东地区，强大的帝国或是宗主国征服了弱小的国家以后，就要他们成为臣属的附庸国。这些宗主国王通常借着盟约或是协定，来执守与附庸国的关系，通常附庸国必须顺服宗主国的法律。以色列与 上帝的关系也是如此，全国的百姓都要顺服 上帝的圣约，而君王的职责就是确保他们会如此的作。

君王在许多方面要确保他的百姓会忠于 上帝的圣约，但是为了本课所讨论的，我们要着重于耶稣所说的律法里比较重要的事项。马太福音23章23节，耶稣这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    那律法上更重的事，就是公义、怜悯、信实。（马太福音23章23节）
</div>

  对耶稣而言，相对于法利赛人重视的礼仪规矩，律法里更重要的特质是公义、怜悯和信实或忠信。

我们要来看旧约的君王该如何按着这每一个重要的特质，来执行并遵守 上帝的律法。首先我们要看君王的职责是伸张公义。第二，君王要施行怜悯。第三，我们要着重于君王必须要提倡忠信。让我们先来看君王的职责是伸张公义。


公义

就君王的职责内容而言，公义的定义是按着 上帝的律法，给予每个人他当得的审判。

<div class = "quote">
作为个人或君王，我们有权利，有自由和意志选择安全的道路还是犯罪的道路。最后 上帝的审判要落在所有人身上。结果就是这些君王要受到审判。耶稣来的时候，他要拨乱反正，在他来之前，我们有一个使命，就是作为属于 上帝国度的个人，作为属天之地的国民去生活。现在我们行事公平正义，尊重他人，尊重软弱的人，公平对待受到不公待遇的人，我们努力要达致公义，知道我们仍然生活在一个有罪的世界，一个破碎的世界，一个在 上帝审判之下的世界，一个仍存在着残暴、贫穷、无知和败坏的世界上。我们就像发光的蜡烛，提醒其他人天上有一位慈爱的 上帝，他看顾受到不公待遇的人；残暴、败坏和骄傲，不管在地上持续多久，这都是暂时的，时间有限，因为有一位 上帝，到最后他要纠正一切。（约拿单•克泰伯博士）
</div>

以色列的君王至少在两个不同层面上要执行 上帝的公义。首先，他们要执行 上帝的国际公义，将 上帝的律法应用于以色列和其它国家的关系上。

君王在国际的层面上伸张公义的方式，是与其它国家作和平的协调，例如列王记上5章1到12节，所罗门王对推罗王希兰所作的。

君王也借着战争来维护国际公义，他们以此惩治那些行恶的国家，例如撒母耳上14章47和48节，扫罗王所作的；还有撒母耳记下8章1到13节，大卫所作的。君王也要在以色列受到攻击时保卫自己的国家，就如撒母耳记下5章17到25节，大卫所作的；还有列王记下19章，希西家王所作的。诗篇2篇总结性的说到，以色列的王要如何以公义对待那些违抗他们和背逆主的国家。第6到12节这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    （主说）：「我已经立我的君在锡安─我的圣山上了。」……耶和华曾对我说：「你是我的儿子，我今日生你。你求我，我就将列国赐你为基业，将地极赐你为田产。你必用铁杖打破他们；你必将他们如同窑匠的瓦器摔碎。」现在，你们君王应当省悟！你们世上的审判官该受管教﹗当存畏惧事奉耶和华，又当存战兢而快乐。当以嘴亲子，恐怕他发怒，你们便在道中灭亡，因为他的怒气快要发作。凡投靠他的，都是有福的。（诗篇2篇第6-12节）
</div>

这些经文是根据古代近东的习俗，看待宗主国的君王为父亲，而附庸国的君王为儿子。 上帝是宗主国王，而大卫是儿子。 上帝对世界的计划是让万国都要服事顺从大卫王，他们要敬畏、尊崇他，因为他是 上帝在世上施行公义的器皿。

在另一方面，君王也有责任在国家的层面上，就是在以色列国内，伸张 上帝的公义。君王借着带领 上帝的子民顺服祂的律法，来执行国家公义，所包含的事项，例如看顾弱者的福利和需要，就如箴言29章14节提到的；要抵挡行恶的人，就如大卫在撒母耳记下4章9到12节所示范的；要惩治罪犯，如同列王记下14章5节讲到的；还要建立稳定的社会，使得人民可以有和乐昌盛的日子，如同诗篇72篇所教导的；此外，君王也不可循私，枉曲公义，偏袒富人或是穷人，厚待有权势或是软弱的人。《圣经》有多处经文讲到君王的角色，例如利未记19章15节，和以赛亚书11章1到5节。

再一次就耶稣所讲的律法里重要的事项，君王第二个主要职责就是施行 上帝的怜悯。


怜悯

怜悯的意思是效法 上帝对祂的受造物的怜恤。 上帝通常在人们犯罪时，以耐心对待他们，并且了解他们的软弱。祂在生活中赐给他们美好的东西，将他们从苦难中解救出来，祂乐于这么作，只是因着祂的良善恩慈。《圣经》多处提到 上帝的怜悯，例如诗篇40篇11节，103篇8节，还有约拿书4章2节。

就如他们施行公义一样，君王至少在两个领域里要施行怜悯，首先就是在国际关系上。在国际层面上，君王要对那些顺服以色列的 上帝的国家和百姓施行怜悯。例如撒母耳记下10章19节，以色列仇敌的附庸国在与以色列和好之后，大卫就向他们施怜悯。还有撒母耳记下10章1和2节，大卫也向亚扪王显示恩慈怜恤之心。

除此外，旧约的先知们也预告说外邦的列国至终要臣服于耶路撒冷，他们要带着贡物来到 上帝国度的京城，并且领受 上帝的君王的怜悯和保护。这些预言是记载在以赛亚书60章1到22节，66章18到23节，还有弥迦书4章1到8节，以及西番雅书2章11节等经文里。

当然，就如在公义的部份我们所谈到的， 上帝并非总是想要施怜悯。有时祂也不准君王对那些行恶的列国施恩，例如撒母耳记下5章17到25节， 上帝指示大卫要歼灭非利士人，大卫就如此遵行，没有向他们施怜悯，因为他们犯的罪如此滔天，以致不得活命。因此君王的职责里，有些部份是要分辨 上帝何时要他们施行怜悯，何时又不要他们那么作。

除了在国际关系上施行怜悯，君王也要在国家层面上，执行 上帝的律法，向百姓施怜悯。君王乃是臣服于 上帝，因此他必须对待 上帝的百姓，如同 上帝对待他们一样，也就是要恩慈的对待他们。何西阿书6章6节提到， 上帝要祂的子民乐意怜悯胜于律法里规定的祭祀。这并非是说 上帝的律法不重要，而是强调怜悯乃是律法里比较重要的事项之一。因此，一个恩慈良善的君王也是个理想的领导者，他是效法 上帝关怀人的榜样。撒母耳记下19章18到23节，大卫就显示这样的行为，向那些臣服于他的敌人表现怜悯之心。

<div class = "quote">
    怜悯贯穿旧约律法之内。如果我们有时能克服我们那种认为律法很糟糕的偏见，真正把律法看作是传递 上帝慈爱的载体，我们就会开始看到到处都有怜悯。就拿我们看作是起点的十诫来说，比如你看像遵守安息日为圣的第四条诫命这样的律法。我们看的时候，要超越这条诫命的前一部分，看到我们自己不仅要在主日或安息日安息，我们还要让我们家里的佣人，我们的牲畜，所有我们拥有的得安息。在我们这个现代世界，我们会说做生意的敬虔男女们应当对自己的雇员有怜悯，不要把他们看作是要榨干用尽的资源，而是要把他们当成人来对待。要作 上帝交给我们管理这些人的管家，所以当中有怜悯的规定。你会看到旧约《圣经》中有大量个别详细的律法，是向人显出怜悯的。申命记中要求人把一些庄稼遗落在田地的角落，让穷人可以来得到一些吃的东西，使他们可以拾取留下的谷物。你还看到其他旧约律法，例如，不可向同胞收取利息的命令。那个世界并不是资本主义的投资经济，收取利息常常变成虐待和占人便宜的方法，那会取代待人的慷慨。如果一个人要占一个贫穷以色列人同胞的便宜，你知道他可能会自己富起来，但他其实是掠夺他人。所以，律法说，不要这样做。而是要慷慨，不收利息，借给有需要的人。每七年释放为奴之人的律法，或者禧年的律法，规定让人重新得回因不幸遭遇失去的土地。所以在这些关于复兴的律法中， 上帝向他的百姓显出怜悯，然后命令他们在旧约律法中思想他自己的品格。（麦克尔•葛罗道牧师）
</div>

除了公义和怜悯，君王执行 上帝的律法要作的第三件事，就是提倡鼓励人们对 上帝的忠信。


忠信

信实或忠信的定义是借着衷心的相信和顺服，显示对 上帝的忠诚。忠信就是相信 上帝对祂自己的宣告，忠诚的服事祂，不敬拜其它的神，而且怀着爱戴之心顺服祂。

就如公义和怜悯的部份所谈到的，君王也必须在两个层面上彰显对 上帝的忠信，首先就是在国际的领域。以色列的君王要带领 上帝的子民对 上帝效忠，好让临近的列国也要为他们拜偶像和罪行而悔改，转而服事 上帝。君王要履行他们的职责，特别是要在以色列国里确立对 上帝的敬拜，例如列王记上8章41到43节，所罗门王在献圣殿时的祷告。这个关乎对列国的教导和带领的普世性任务也见于诗篇72篇8到11节，还有撒迦利亚书8章20到23节。

除了在国际上提倡对 上帝的忠信，君王也要在国家的层面上鼓励百姓存忠信的心。君王要在以色列国内提倡忠信，特别是要持守并提倡对 上帝专一的敬拜。良善的君王会提供百姓敬拜所需要的资源和计划，为圣殿的维修，筹组人事和制订法规；并且通常在公共的敬拜庆典中扮演重要的角色，例如历代志上15、16、23到28章，大卫就作了这些事情。

君王定意要培养以色列民对 上帝的忠信，对于全国会有深远的影响。因为他是在 上帝面前代表全民，因此在忠信的君王领导之下，百姓通常蒙受极大的祝福，而在不忠信的君王治理下承受 上帝大而可畏的咒诅。 上帝给以色列民繁荣昌盛及其扩展的疆界，以此祝福忠信的君王。相反，不忠信的君王则受责罚。事实上，列王纪上下将犹大被掳的部分罪过归结为他们君王的不顺服。列王记上9章6到7节， 上帝对所罗门王这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    倘若你们和你们的子孙转去不跟从我，不守我指示你们的诫命律例，去事奉敬拜别神，我就必将以色列人从我赐给他们的地上剪除，并且我为己名所分别为圣的殿也必舍弃不顾，使以色列人在万民中作笑谈，被讥诮。（列王记上9章6-7节）
</div>

可悲的是，并非以色列和犹大国的每个君王都是忠于 上帝的，也因此百姓经常为此受苦。然而即使圣殿被弃置不顾，或是百姓堕落去拜偶像，还是有忠于 上帝的君王起来改革归正，带领全国恢复对 上帝的敬拜。我们在列王记下18章1到8节，读到希西家的事迹；还有列王记下22章1节到23章25节，约西亚王的故事。他们改革的努力激发 上帝的子民，转而对 上帝忠信；也因此 上帝也愿意在他们治理的时候祝福这个国家。

我们读过了旧约君王的资格和职责之后，现在来看旧约对于以色列未来君王的期盼。


期盼

旧约对于未来的君王有许多期盼，特别是先知预言提到的，要达成 上帝的目标，在地上建立祂的国度的那一位弥赛亚君王。当然，新约启示，这位弥赛亚君王就是耶稣。因此我们要来仔细查考旧约的这些期盼。

对于以色列未来君王的期盼是建立在两个根源上，第一，旧约王权的历史发展；第二，关乎以色列未来君王的明确预言。让我们先来看王权的历史发展所引发的期盼。


历史发展

我们先来看在以色列的前君王期，就是从创造阶段到以色列的士师时代，人类的君王在 上帝的计划里所扮演的重要角色。


前君王期

当 上帝创造这个世界时，祂将亚当和夏娃安置在伊甸园里，要他们负责管理受造的万物。创世记1章26和27节，当 上帝计划，并按着祂的形象创造亚当和夏娃时，就指明人类所要承担的职份。

在旧约时代，神的形象，与神祗相似，以及神的儿子这样的名词，通常是用来指君王和皇帝。这样的词语表明一个信念，就是君王乃是神明在地上的代表或是总督，因此君王有责任确保他的神明的旨意在地上能够达成。那么，当《圣经》说亚当和夏娃有 上帝的形象时，就是意味着 上帝任命整个人类作为祂在地上的代理摄政。从一个广义的角度而言，所有的人类受造都有君尊的位份，以王的身份服事 上帝，确保 上帝的旨意得以成就在地上。 上帝的形象是君尊的表征，这个概念有助于我们了解创世记1章28节，在那里， 上帝给予人类的先祖这个命令：

<div class = "quote">
    要生养众多，遍满地面，治理这地，也要管理海里的鱼、空中的鸟，和地上各样行动的活物。（创世记1章28节）
</div>

上帝要把全地都转变成为祂的国度，因此祂任命祂的代理摄政，就是人类，要生养众多，让全地布满其他有 上帝形象的人，也要治理所有的受造物。这个命令通常被称为是文化使命或御令，因为它命令我们要把世界治理成有文化有文明，合乎 上帝心意的国度。

亚当和夏娃堕落犯罪之后，他们和他们的子孙就逐渐离弃这些起初的职责，到一个地步， 上帝以挪亚时代的洪水来审判有罪的人类。即使是这样， 上帝也没有免除人类在世上君尊的职责。在挪亚和他的家人出了方舟之后， 上帝对他们重申文化使命，命令所有君尊的人，要把敬畏 上帝的文明传布到全世界。

但是人类代理摄政的身份在亚伯拉罕时代有了一个重大的改变， 上帝赎出亚伯拉罕，以他为 上帝的选民以色列人之父。虽然从广义来说，全人类依旧是 上帝的代理摄政，但主选择亚伯拉罕和他的后裔成为地上所有家庭的长子。创世记15章和17章， 上帝与亚伯拉罕立了一个圣约，指明以色列民有个君尊的特权，要为 上帝建立圣洁的国度，并且以这个国度起首，将 上帝的旨意传布到世界其它国家。

后来在历史上， 上帝开始履行祂给亚伯拉罕的应许，差遣摩西和约书亚去带领以色列人。在他们的治理之下， 上帝把祂的子民从埃及为奴之地救赎出来，给他们能力，征服迦南地，就是应许之地；在那里他们要成为一个得蒙救赎，有 上帝圣洁形象的大国。

可悲的是，以色列人没有全然征服迦南地，因此在约书亚死了之后，国家的统一就瓦解了，由不同的地方士师和利未人带领各支派，度过了那段艰难多灾的日子。虽然 上帝还是在那些年日祝福以色列，可是士师和利未人的带领，不足以能够将以色列人带到一个有 上帝君尊形象的领导国度。士师记的作者在整卷书里很清楚的显示这点。士师记21章25节，书的最后一句话这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    那时，以色列中没有王，各人任意而行。（士师记21章25节）
</div>

士师记17章6节，18章1节，还有19章1节，也有类似的评论。这些重复出现的话强调一个重点，以色列唯有在公义的君王，以 上帝代理摄政的身份治理之下，才能够成为蒙 上帝拣选，合祂心意的国家。

<div class = "quote">
    士师记看起来是为君王的出现提供了理由。士师记中有一种循环，士师兴起，一段时间好了，然后百姓落入罪中，他们向 上帝呼求， 上帝再兴起另外一位士师。因此，作者显然是要说明这一点，就是人们需要某些更稳定，更安全的，盼望要有一位合 上帝心意的统治者和领袖，当然那些品格是特别适用于大卫，这位合 上帝心意的君王身上。他被看作是君王该有样式的楷模，不仅对当时的以色列人是这样，实际上还表明 上帝怎样在他的百姓之上行使王权。这样，士师记就可以算作是某种论证，证明需要有一位君王，一位在 上帝之下治理的君王，让我们看到 上帝怎样治理当时百姓的君王，确实也会怎样治理今天的百姓。（西门•沃伯特博士）
<br>
    很要紧的是要把士师记这卷书放在 上帝的全盘计划中，从创世记一直到耶稣基督降临的故事线索中来看。士师记回顾之前的启示，一直回溯到身为君王般的人物亚当那里，然后亚伯拉罕在亚伯拉罕之约中期望君王从他后裔而出；摩西颁布旧约时，在申命记17章展望君王的临到。然而，在 上帝的计划里并不是在那个时刻，就让君王实际的出现。因此，士师记在某种意义上，就是让人看到需要有这样的领袖，需要这般的治理。在这一点上，约书亚接续摩西，士师们接续约书亚。然而还没有 上帝预期将要来到的君王，还没有应验。士师们，取决于他们的领导能力，如果他们还算好，民族通常就不会太糟糕。如果他们是恶人，民族就会遭殃，而当时却没有君王。士师记告诉我们，君王来到的时候，事情会变得好起来。旧约告诉我们这些事将会应验成就。当然，接着我们就从师士到了扫罗和大卫的时期，他们两位被对比的呈现出来，一个是人选择的王，另一个是 上帝选择的王，以此带领我们进入重大的大卫之约，及其大卫那个更伟大后裔的应许。这一切都是出于 上帝的计划，预备我们期待主耶稣基督的来临，向我们彰显在众王中一个真正君王的风范，表明我们需要这个君王来恢复我们起初被造的目的。这都是 上帝计划的一部份，把众人引导到基督耶稣那里。（司提反•威乐姆博士）
</div>
我们已经看过在以色列前君王期，人类王权的起始，现在要来探讨以色列君王期的历史发展。

君王期

根据撒母耳记上8章5到20节，在士师时代的末期，以色列国羡慕邻邦的列国在君王治理之下，社会稳定有秩序，但是他们拒绝等候 上帝，在祂所定的时候为他们兴起一个王。他们反而要求 上帝马上给他们一个王。 上帝于是任命扫罗，作为以色列第一个正式受命的君王

我们必须了解，以色列人想要一个君王，这事件本身并不是一个罪。 上帝在之前已经多次启示，祂计划要让以色列成为一个有君王治理的强大国家。例如在创世记17章6节， 上帝应许亚伯拉罕，君王会从他的后裔而出。还有创世记49章8到10节，雅各为他的儿子犹大祝福，宣告犹大的后裔要以君王身份治理以色列人。在本课的前面我们也看到，摩西甚至在申命记17章14到19节，制订以色列君王该具备的资格。除此之外，撒母耳记上2章10节，在以色列人要求 上帝给予他们一个王之前，合 上帝心意的哈拿已经献上一个带预言的祷告，讲到 上帝至终会设立一个公义的君王来治理祂的百姓。

但是尽管 上帝有计划为以色列人设王，全国的人却拒绝相信 上帝，不肯等候祂的时间表，这就成为他们的罪。 上帝指派扫罗为王，部份原因就是要为他们的罪而惩戒他们。扫罗王虽然在某些方面将以色列人带往 上帝期待的方向，然而他自己对 上帝的背逆，却使得 上帝废弃他和他的家室。

但是在扫罗失败之后， 上帝还是很恩待以色列人，给予他们需要的君王，就是兴起大卫为王。就像所有堕落的人类一样，大卫也是个罪人，但他也是个合 上帝心意的人。 上帝给予他能力得以统一整个国家，打败仇敌，给以色列带来和平兴盛的时期。除此之外， 上帝也和大卫立了一个圣约，就是他的后裔要永远统治以色列，成为永久的王朝。我们在撒母耳记下7章，历代志上17章，还有诗篇89与132篇，读到这 上帝与大卫立的这个约。

大卫死了之后，他的儿子所罗门接续他作王。就许多方面而言，所罗门统治时，是以色列君王历史里最鼎盛的时期。他扩张以色列的疆界，为国家增添许多财富和好名声。可悲的是，他也严重的违逆 上帝的律法准则，去敬拜他的外邦妻妾所拜的神；因此 上帝在所罗门儿子罗波安的时候，把国家分成南北两个部份，而接下去的世代变得更加不忠于 上帝，以致最后以色列和犹大都受到 上帝的审判，承受被掳与流放的命运。北国以色列在主前723或722年，被亚述所征服，南国犹大在主前587或是586年，被巴比伦所侵占，最后一个合法的君王是大卫的后裔约雅斤，又称为耶哥尼雅，他在主前597年被废黜，并且遭到囚禁。

在君王期结束的时候， 上帝对于人类的王权有许多启示。从最广义的层面而言，所有的人类都是 上帝的代表，要治理全地；就较狭义范围而言，以色列国具有特别代理摄政的位份，被立为人类的神圣家族，要作为其他国家的表率；而从最狭义层面来说，大卫君尊的后裔要承受 上帝的首席代理摄政的职份。 上帝任命大卫的子孙要带领以色列人和世界其他国家，服事并成就至高之王， 上帝他自己的旨意。

我们已经讨论了以色列在前君王期和君王期两个时代里，君王职份的历史发展，现在要来探讨后君王期，就是以色列和犹大百姓被掳流离在外，没有大卫的子孙做王的那个时期。


后君王期

虽然巴比伦摧毁了耶路撒冷，而且废了大卫子孙的王位；但是波斯王古列又征服了巴比伦，并且颁布命令，准许以色列回返原来的应许之地。我们从历代志下36章和以斯拉记1章，读到这个历史记载。

古列王颁布诏书之后的几年通常被称为是回归时期，那些回归的人重新洁净向 上帝献祭的坛，建筑新的圣殿，并且还重修耶路撒冷的城墙。早先，在哈该书2章21到23节，先知哈该甚至告诉这些回归的剩余子民，如果他们忠于 上帝， 上帝就会任命他们的省长所罗巴伯，就是大卫的一个后裔，来接续大卫的王位。然而这些百姓并没有忠于 上帝，因此旧约就结束于一些以色列的剩余子民住在应许之地，期盼那延迟到未来的荣耀。

在新、旧两约期间，以色列人对 上帝的叛逆继续延迟以色列王权的恢复。希腊帝国打败波斯帝国，统治了巴勒斯坦的以色列人。后来，罗马帝国又征服了希腊，也接管应许之地。在这段时期，以色列没有 上帝所授命的君王。

以色列历经亚述、巴比伦、玛代和波斯、希腊与罗马的压制，这悲惨的情况清楚显示一件事：大卫公义子孙的统治对于以色列的未来是生死存亡的事。以色列需要一个大卫王朝的君王来成就 上帝的选民在世上的作用。因此， 上帝忠信的百姓继续仰望 上帝会履行祂与大卫所立的约，差派一个公义的大卫子孙为王，来救赎他们脱离外族的压制，并且扩展 上帝的旨意到世界各地。

我们已经谈过了君王职份的历史发展，现在要来看旧约对于未来王权期盼的一些明确预言。


明确预言

旧约对于以色列王权的未来实在有太多的预言，我们无法一一讨论。为了这一课的目的，我们只能谈到其中四个重要的主题。第一，旧约的先知们预告 上帝将要恢复大卫王朝。

<div class = "quote">
    旧约《圣经》特别强调弥赛亚首先是大卫的子孙。当然大卫是那位以色列的伟大君王，他极其地信靠耶和华，获得极大的胜利，在很多很多方面顺服耶和华。当然，他也有一些明显的失败，但大卫成了弥赛亚将会是一位怎样的君王的范例。他将是给民族带来和平的君王。所以我们在旧约《圣经》后半部分看到，在大卫死后，人们一直期望有一位大卫的子孙要来，这特别与将要有的和平、公义和喜乐的理念相互一致。（汤姆•史瑞纳博士）
<br>
    在旧约《圣经》中，所说的弥赛亚这个人物是一位君王，从大卫家谱而出的君王。 上帝与大卫立约，在那约中， 上帝应许大卫，有一天 上帝要兴起一位君王，这位君王是要以一种特别、独特的 上帝儿子的身份，就是作为 上帝独生子的关系。他要在大卫的宝座上永远作王，他要建立公正公义。所以，当我们去看旧约《圣经》的弥赛亚时，我们实际上是特指一位君王。那位最终的君王，要带来 上帝的救恩和拯救的君王。（马可•斯特劳斯博士）
</div>

先知们说 上帝至终会差派一个公义的大卫子孙，来恢复以色列大卫家的王权。《圣经》里多处提到这样的预言，例如诗篇89篇、以赛亚书9章7节，和16章5节，耶利米书23章5节，和33章25到26节，以及以西结书34章23和24节。就其中一个例子，我们来听阿摩司书9章11节， 上帝借着先知阿摩司所说的话：

<div class = "quote">
    到那日，我必建立大卫倒塌的帐幕，堵住其中的破口，把那破坏的建立起来，重新修造，像古时一样。（阿摩司书9章11节）
</div>

第二个主题是，先知们预告这个未来的大卫子孙会带给 上帝的百姓自由与对他们仇敌的得胜。旧约先知们经常讲到将来会有一个时候， 上帝会奇妙的介入人类的历史，为着祂忠信的子民，制服他们的仇敌。 上帝应许要施行审判，惩罚那些敌对祂的人，包括以色列那些不忠于 上帝的人。先知们也重复的把这个得胜，与将来在大卫宝座上的那个子孙， 上帝的伟大代理摄政，相联在一起。这些预告的期待，是记载在诗篇132篇17到18节，以赛亚书9章4到7节，耶利米书30章5到17节，以西结书34章2节，还有撒迦利亚书12章1到10节。例如，耶利米书30章8和9节，记载这个预言：

<div class = "quote">
    万军之耶和华说：「到那日，」 「我必从你颈项上折断仇敌的轭，扭开他的绳索；外邦人不得再使你作他们的奴仆。你们却要事奉耶和华─你们的 上帝和我为你们所要兴起的王大卫。」（耶利米书30章8-9节） 
</div>

第三，旧约的先知们预告这个未来的大卫子孙要建立一个永久性国度。旧约的先知们经常教导说，这个伟大的大卫子孙要统治以色列，他们要永远享受 上帝美好的祝福。大卫后裔的这位君王会将全地治理的如同天上一般，他的百姓要享有平安昌盛的生活。这样的期盼可见于以赛亚书55章3到13节，还有以西结书37章24和25节等《圣经》经文。例如，以赛亚书9章7节，以赛亚说到这个未来的大卫子孙：

<div class = "quote">
    他的政权与平安必加增无穷。他必在大卫的宝座上治理他的国，以公平公义使国坚定稳固，从今直到永远。万军之耶和华的热心必成就这事。（以赛亚书9章7节）
</div>

第四个主题是，旧约先知也教导说，这个未来的大卫子孙会建立一个普世性国度。未来的大卫国度在时间和疆界都是没有限制的，它会扩展到全地，那些为罪悔改的人会蒙受祝福，不管他们是什么国籍或是族裔。我们在诗篇2、68、72、110和122篇，都读到这样的应许。但以理书7章13和14节，如此描述将来这个未来君王和其国度的情况：

<div class = "quote">
    见有一位像人子的，驾着天云而来……得了权柄、荣耀、国度，使各方、各国、各族的人都事奉他。（但以理书7章13-14节）
<br>
    认识弥赛亚角色的其中一处关键旧约《圣经》经文，就是诗篇第2篇，它清楚地讲到 上帝怎样已经在锡安，他的圣山上设立了这位特别的君王，这位受膏者，这位弥赛亚。若是你仔细读得话，你会发现这个 上帝要设立的君王，他将要成为统治全世界的主宰。万民都要向他顺服。在他的权柄中，万民和地上的君王都要屈膝来敬拜他，事实上，诗篇第2篇的语言是呼吁人以嘴亲子。这要表达的意思，就是他不仅是以色列的弥赛亚，虽然他是，而是因为他是以色列的弥赛亚，他也是全世界的主，统治全世界理当的主。所以要明白的其中一样关键事情，就是弥赛亚是一位人物，实际上要认识到，他是一位要来，要统治世界的人物。（彼得•瓦尔科尔博士）
</div>

旧约结束时，人们怀着期盼，期盼未来的君王临到， 上帝将要差派一个特别的大卫子孙，成为祂最尊贵的代理摄政。他必打败 上帝子民所有的仇敌，也要为那些顺服他权柄的人，在地上建立一个永恒的国度。这个国度必成就 上帝原本的目的，就是祂要那些照着祂形象而造的人所应该达成的，也会履行 上帝对以色列本来的旨意，更会达成 上帝原先持定的大卫家永远掌权的计划。这位公义的大卫子孙会使整个世界成为 上帝的国度，他必除灭一切的邪恶，使他的子民能永远过着和平昌盛的生活。


三、在耶稣里全然实现

我们已经探讨了君王职份的旧约背景，现在要来看本课的第二个主题，就是君王职份在耶稣身上全然实现。新约清楚教导说，耶稣就是旧约所应许的那位大卫子孙。例如马太福音2章2节，东方来的博士描述他是犹太人的王；马可福音8章27到29节，耶稣的门徒们也把弥赛亚或是基督的尊称加给他；约翰福音1章49节，他被称为是以色列的王。而最重要的是，就在他临死的时候，耶稣宣称他自己就是旧约所应许的那个弥赛亚君王。马太福音27章11节记载，耶稣与本丢彼拉多的对话：

<div class = "quote">
    巡抚问他说：你是犹太人的王吗？耶稣说：你说的是。（马太福音27章11节）
</div>

类似的记载也出现在马可福音15章2节，路加福音23章1到3节，还有约翰福音18章33到37节。即使耶稣在世上服事的期间并没有登上以色列的王座，但是新约清楚教导说他的确就是所应许的那位要作王的大卫子孙，而且他将来还会再回来，完成旧约对于大卫宝座的每一个期盼。

类似于我们查考君王职份的旧约背景，我们对于君王职份在耶稣身上的实现，也分三个要点来探讨。第一，我们要看耶稣符合君王职份的资格；第二，我们要探究耶稣如何履行君王的职责；第三，我们要探讨耶稣如何符合旧约对于未来君王服事的期盼。让我们先来看耶稣的君王资格。


资格

我们在这一课里，早先曾提到摩西的律法列出君王的四个资格，首先，君王必须蒙 上帝所拣选；第二，他必须是个以色列人；第三，他要倚靠 上帝，才得以建立昌盛稳定的国家；第四，他在治理国家和个人生活上要忠于 上帝的圣约。除了这些资格以外， 上帝与大卫的圣约特别讲到君王必须是大卫的子孙。我们现在就来探讨，耶稣如何符合这每一个资格，让我们先来看他是蒙 上帝所拣选。


蒙 上帝所拣选

我们前面曾提过， 上帝是至高的君王或宗主，统管万有，以色列的君王则是臣属 上帝的附庸王或藩王，管理 上帝特别的子民，圣洁的国度以色列。既然只有 上帝可以分授祂的权柄， 上帝也必须拣选所有合法的君王，来领受和执行 上帝给予的权柄，治理他的国家。

耶稣符合这些资格，因为他是 上帝所拣选并且指定成为以色列的王。我们从马太福音1章1到17节，耶稣的家谱看到这个事实，还有天使加百列对马利亚宣告耶稣的出生也讲到这点。路加福音1章31到33节，加百列对马利亚这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    你要怀孕生子，可以给他起名叫耶稣。他要为大，称为至高者的儿子；主 上帝要把他祖大卫的位给他。他要作雅各家的王，直到永远；他的国也没有穷尽。（路加福音1章31-33节）
</div>

上帝清楚表明，祂已经拣选耶稣为君王，统治祂的百姓。君王的第二个资格是，他必须是个以色列人。


以色列人

耶稣符合是以色列人的这个资格是不用说的，因为他是出生于一个以色列家庭。他奇妙的道成肉身，在童女马利亚的腹中被孕育，这使得他的诞生很不寻常，但是他依法仍然是约瑟和马利亚的孩子，也是以色列这个圣约民族的一份子。马太福音1章，和路加福音3章，耶稣的家谱证实了这一点，而类似罗马书9章5节的经文则是讲到耶稣的先祖是以色列人。

旧约列出君王的第三个资格是要倚靠 上帝，而非靠人为的策略，去谋求和平与昌盛。


倚靠上帝

耶稣符合这个资格，因为他全然倚靠 上帝的能力，去为他的百姓建立平安和昌盛的生活。他不会试着与希律或是彼拉多，或是其它人类的政府缔结联盟。相反的，他全心倚靠 上帝的权柄和能力，去建造他的国度，就如我们在约翰福音13章3节，19章10和11节等经文所读到的。

耶稣符合旧约关于君王的第四个资格，他借着持守 上帝命定的律法，显示他是忠于 上帝的圣约。


忠于上帝的圣约

我们从许多方面可以看得耶稣忠于 上帝的律法，特别是他持守律法的原意，也尽心要履行律法所要求的每个事项。例如，在马太福音5章到7章的登山宝训，耶稣屡次强调律法所包含的原来意思，与律法师口传的教导是截然不同。除此外，耶稣特别讲到他来，是为了成全律法的每个细节。马太福音5章17到18节，耶稣这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    莫想我来要废掉律法和先知。我来不是要废掉，乃是要成全。我实在告诉你们，就是到天地都废去了，律法的一点一画也不能废去，都要成全。（马太福音5章17-18节）
</div>

罗马书8章3和4节，使徒保罗回应耶稣的话，他说耶稣成全所有的律法，不单是为着他自己，也是为我们而这么行。

<div class = "quote">
    《圣经》说律法是一位师傅，把我们指向基督，带我们到他那里，预备我们去相信他。 上帝赐下律法，律法反映出 上帝的品格，但我们未能遵守律法。所以当耶稣来的时候，他让我们看到完全的人性实现了 上帝要它达到的目的，就是以信守 上帝的命令预表出来与 上帝的关系。所以耶稣来，让我们看到真正的人性当有的样式。但耶稣也通过为我们遵守了律法，通过他守约、遵守律法的行为，始终向 上帝忠心，以此守全了律法。所以他成为了我们的义。《圣经》说 上帝既是公义的，也称人为义。并且正如他带着他的律法来，然后他带着为我们遵守律法的他的儿子来。这样他既是那位义者，也是在基督里称我们为义的那一位。（埃瑞克•索尼斯博士）
<br>
    很重要的是要强调，耶稣守约，这正是他有权作我们君王的根据。我的意思是这牵涉到许多主题，其实是一直回到亚当那里的。亚当作为我们的头，我们全人类的代表，要像 上帝所造的所有人一样，向 上帝顺服忠心。我们是受造的人，我们是应当顺服造我们的 上帝，在我们生活的每一个方面服事他，顺服他，爱慕他。亚当悖逆，与之带来的是罪恶、死亡和审判。要逆转这一点的唯一方法，就是我们需要 上帝为我们作出补救，通过另外一位亚当，通过另外一个人作出补救。所以我们看到这个突出的重点， 上帝要通过这些不同的先知、祭司和君王，提供一位像亚当的，最终的顶点就是我们的主耶稣基督，你看福音书，就知道他来遵行 上帝的旨意。他来顺服。加拉太书第4章说他由妇人所生，生在律法之下，为要顺从一切的律法。为什么一定要这样？因为他要逆转亚当所做的。通过祂的顺服，我们想到这点，不仅是按他的生命来讲的，这里他的生活也很重要。通过顺服，有时我们把这叫作他的「顺服之举」，他就为我们满足了律法所有的要求。通过他的顺服，最重要的是在他受死的这件事上，按腓立比书第2章说的，他顺服以至于死，且死在十字架上。然后，他因着这工作的功德，作为我们君王、我们祭司的那顺服的功德；他得到高举，升到 上帝的右边。这不是说他在这之前不是君王、不是主，作为 上帝的儿子，他一直都是君王和主。然而他是通过他的工作，作道成肉身的子 上帝，他要通过他的人性，顺服、忠心，代表我们顺服忠心，使他能为我们赢取我们的救恩。若没有对父 上帝的完全顺服和忠心，在弥赛亚的工作、那作王的工作中，他就不可能按着 上帝所赐的作万王之王，万主之主。（司提反•威乐姆博士） 
</div>

耶稣符合旧约的第五个资格就是他是大卫的子孙。


大卫的子孙

上帝与大卫立的圣约，乃是确立大卫的后裔为以色列永远的统治者，因此只有大卫的子孙才能合法的承继以色列的王权。《圣经》多处清楚提到耶稣乃是大卫家的一份子，例如马太福音1章1到25节，罗马书1章1到3节，启示录5章5节，还有22章16节。

我们已经看过了耶稣承担王权的资格，让我们来看耶稣作到君王当尽的职责。


职责

我们之前曾经提到，君王基本的职责，就是代表 上帝，忠心治理附属于 上帝的国家，特别是要遵行 上帝的律法。所有的基督徒都知道，耶稣在世上服事期间并没有完成他的工作；事实上，我们的耶稣君王是从天上，以及借着现今的教会继续在工作；而且他至终还要再回来，完成他的工作。虽然如此，他所做成的，已经足以让我们相信他的确就是基督，是 上帝所差派来复兴祂国度的大卫家的君王。

正如我们讨论君王职务的旧约背景所用的重点，我们也以此来探讨耶稣的君王职责，那就是伸张公义，施行怜悯，以及提倡忠信。让我们先来看耶稣如何伸张公义。


公义

就如前面的讨论，我们也是以两个层面来探讨公义的执行，首先就是国际的公义。耶稣在地上的服事，多半没有直接关涉到人为的政府，但他是借着与撒旦国度和他的鬼魔对抗，并且释放那些被罪把持挟制的人，以此来持守并伸张公义。《圣经》描述这是 上帝国度和撒旦国度的属灵战争，例如路加福音11章14到20节，还有以弗所书2章2节都谈到这点。因此，我们可以把耶稣所作的，比对旧约君王借着战争来维护国际正义。马太福音12章28节，耶稣这么说道：

<div class = "quote">
    我若靠着 上帝的灵赶鬼，这就是 上帝的国临到你们了。（马太福音12章28节）
</div>

在这节经文里，耶稣指出他能够赶鬼，就足以证明他是在率领 上帝的国度，对抗撒旦的国度。旧约的君王也借着与其它国家的和平协定来执行国际公义。虽然耶稣并不常这么作，他的确有从东方来的博士那里收到和平的赠礼，马太福音2章记载他们带了礼物来献给耶稣，这些博士们代表外邦的国家，他们的用意，就是要使得他们的国家与以色列的新生王有和好的关系。

除了执行国际公义，耶稣也在以色列国内持守 上帝的公义。就如其他人类君王一样，耶稣通常不会涉入一些个人的纷争事件里，他让地方法庭和审判官去处理那些事件。但是耶稣经常教导人要持守公义，例如马太福音5章25和26节，12章15到21节，还有路加福音18章7和8节，都谈到这点。另外，他也保证对于善行和恶行会有明确的记录，以致当他再回来施行审判的时候，可以有公平的判断。马太福音10章15节，11章22到24节，以及12章36节，都谈到耶稣的这个君尊职责，经文描述耶稣讲到他在将来所要施行的审判；还有约翰福音5章22节，耶稣讲到他就是那个要施行审判的人。

除了执行公义，耶稣也按着 上帝的律法施怜悯，履行其君王的职责。


怜悯

耶稣效法 上帝对所有受造物的爱心，彰显他君尊的怜悯。当百姓犯罪的时候，他显出耐心，他了解他们的软弱，供应他们的需要，也帮助舒解他们的痛苦。

<div class = "quote">
    按照我们正常的关于王权的人类历史，我们想到君王的时候，总会想到某位拥有绝对权柄的人。他们走进来，人们就开始下拜，他们要什么，君王的愿望是什么，人们就做什么。但是耶稣的君王职分，就像他生活中每一件事情一样，看来是把整个世界体系彻底颠覆。我在想约翰福音第一章，约翰在那里使用了创造主的概念，耶稣是创造世界的那一位。《圣经》说他到他自己的地方来，他自己的人倒不接待他。对任何说我信耶稣是君王的人来说，包括我，你若把像这节经文的话放在这里，你会想，一位到他自己造的世界来，又容许自己被人拒绝的君王，他会是一种怎样的君王呢？所以我想到，主显出怜悯，这不仅仅是因为他可怜我们，我肯定他是可怜我们，但我想这是因为他要启示某些关于 上帝内在生命的事情。怜悯与三位一体 上帝的生命相关。从我根据永恒的角度来看，这位君王他自己，圣父、圣子、圣灵，全宇宙的君王，是一位在三位一体之内，向另外一位委身自己的 上帝，父向子委身，子向父委身，圣灵向其他两位委身。所以，当耶稣来向罪人显出怜悯时，他是表现出这种委身自己的爱，这是君王对自己的启示。他要审判，他最终要定那些不爱他的人为有罪。但是，当他到地上来，他是到一群被虐待，被各种邪恶势力和魔鬼自己扭曲的人这里来；这位君王来，他说，我不打算对你们有任何要求。他先说，我要来，把我自己交给你们。因此，他所有的怜悯作为，都是三位一体 上帝的心怀，在这世上把自己交出来的作为，这就是我们这位君王做工的方式。他来，不带着任何要求，他来是舍己。我想怜悯奇妙表明了始于 上帝心怀的那舍己之爱，在道成肉身中，耶稣去到哪里，就把这种爱传给那里的人。当然，他爱的高潮是在十字架上他对我们的怜悯，这位君王受死舍命，为的是我们可以得到 上帝的怜悯得蒙救赎。所以，他是唯一真正怜悯的君王，他通过他君王的职分描写出这种怜悯是怎样的怜悯。（比尔•乌瑞博士）
<br>
    耶稣来向人显出怜悯，因为他就是满有怜悯的那一位。然而，我现在想的是他的八福。有几样是让我震惊的。第二个有福是这样说的，哀恸的人有福了，因为他们必得安慰。对我来说这意味着那些内心因着伤了 上帝的心而破碎的人是有福了。所以当 上帝取了人的肉体来到地上时，他环顾他的世界，看到的是令他难过的事。他不是只是哭泣，他说，我不仅要流泪，还要带着怜悯进入那些处境。很有意思的是，巴克莱认为在新约《圣经》希腊文中，怜悯这个词的意思是进入到肌肤里去。所以，这种对怜悯的整体理解，意味着我能感受到他们此刻正在感受的。不是只是说我很幸运不在场，不过我会去到那里的，而是说我要往他们那里去，我要对待他们，就像我相信父 上帝要我此时此刻对待他们一样去对待他们。（马太•弗瑞德曼博士）
</div>

我们要从两个层面来看耶稣如何表现他的怜悯，首先是国际的领域。在国际层面上，君王要对那些顺服 上帝的邦国和人民施怜悯，耶稣以几种方式表现这一点。第一，他给许多外邦人，就是不属以色列国的人，施行奇妙的医治，马太福音15章28节，记载他医治一个迦南妇人的女儿；马太福音8章13节，耶稣医治一个罗马百夫长的仆人；马可福音5章1到20节，他从一个外邦地区的人身上赶出一群鬼。

除此以外，耶稣也在一些外邦的区域传道服事，包括推罗、西顿和底加波利，使得他的信息和事工成为启示外邦人的光，就如西面在路加福音2章32节所预言会发生的。

除了国际层面的怜悯，耶稣君尊的怜悯更清楚的彰显在国家的层面上。身为君王，耶稣有责任对待 上帝的子民，如同 上帝对待他们那样；这意味着要存着仁慈待他们。良善的君王就是照着 上帝关怀百姓的方式，以仁慈治理他们。耶稣身为以色列的君王，向他的百姓显出极大的怜悯。他有数年之久，耐心的教导劝诫他们，施行无数的神迹，医治他们的疾病，赶出污鬼，变食物喂饱饥饿的人，甚至使死人复活。

但是最能够表现他君尊怜悯的神迹，莫过于他医治那个瘫痪的病人。那是记载在马太福音9章1到7节，马可福音2章1到11节，还有路加福音5章17到25节。在那个事件里，耶稣不只是医治那个人的瘫痪，还赦免了他的罪。路加福音7章36到50节，他也作类似的事情，他赦免那个以香膏膏抹他脚的妇人所犯的罪。

<div class = "quote">
    正确回答这个问题，是非常非常重要的：为什么只有 上帝才能赦免罪？《圣经》的回答就是，因为他是我们得罪的那一位。他是主，他是创造主，他是造我们的那一位。我们在每一件事上都对他有亏欠，我们的罪、第一主要的是得罪了他。罪对人彼此带来影响，罪对宇宙带来影响， 但是第一主要的，按照我们是在 上帝面前承载他形象的这种关系，我们对他的背叛就是犯罪得罪他。只有他才能赦罪。你会想到诗篇51篇，大卫说，「我向你犯罪，惟独得罪了你。」你想到大卫的一生，我的意思是，他犯罪得罪了很多人，他影响了全国，他影响了乌利亚，他影响了拔示巴，他影响了他的儿子。但是，大卫正确看到，最终而言他是在 上帝面前犯了罪。人们往往没有认识到的我们的问题，人的问题，只有 上帝才能解决我们罪的问题，只有 上帝才能赦免罪。（司提反•威乐姆博士）
<br>
    我得罪某人，或者某人得罪我，在人之间提出和同意饶恕的请求，发生的事情就是，一方说，「我不会让你得罪我的事成为关系方面的拦阻，妨碍我们继续的关系。」这很重要，我们必须以此互相对待，反映出我们是认识到，我们是如何得到 上帝赦免的。但是，当 上帝赦免的时候，他如此赦免，以致实际上取消了客观存在的我的罪债，这是我无法向别人做的，别人也无法向我做的。因此， 上帝取消了我客观存在的罪债，这样饶恕了我。这是 上帝的赦免，很有意思，例如，在马可福音2章，耶稣医治那位瘫子，对他说，「小子，你的罪赦了。」坐在那里的文士们看到这情景，《圣经》告诉我们，他们心里说，大概是自己默默地想，「这个人为什么这样说呢？他说僭妄的话了，除了 上帝以外，谁能赦罪呢？」 这正可谓是要点所在。他们听见耶稣说，他是按照只有 上帝才能赦罪的方式赦免这人的罪，他们因此心里不安；他们认定他是在亵渎 上帝。这意味着他们听明白了他说的话，但对他的回应却是错了。这是四福音书中证明耶稣神性的一个很有力证据。在耶稣自己对自己的认识，他自己的自我宣告中，这宣告是赦罪的宣告，不仅仅只是除去关系方面的冒犯 — 他应该之前从未见过这位瘫子，但是他以如此的方式赦罪，是按照 上帝才能做到的方式，实际上取消了他们客观存在的罪债。（罗伯特•李斯特博士）
</div>

所有的罪都是过犯，也是触犯 上帝，祂乃是公义的至高准则。而且，既然只有 上帝是至高的君王，能施行最终的审判，也是唯一有权柄可以饶恕那些触犯祂的人，只有 上帝有权柄可以显示这样层面的恩慈。因着耶稣是 上帝完全公义的臣属君王， 上帝给予他这样的权柄来施行赦免，这使得耶稣也能够将 上帝的怜悯施行于祂的百姓。

耶稣履行君王职责的第三个方式是执行 上帝的律法，以此提倡对 上帝的忠信。


忠信

就如公义和怜悯的施行，耶稣也是在两个层面上培养人们对 上帝的忠信，首先我们来看在国际方面他所作的。耶稣用最直接的方式，就是向外邦的国家传讲 上帝国度的信息，帮助那些人以诚心来敬拜 上帝，并且顺服祂。我们在马太福音4章13到25节，24章14节，还有路加福音24章47节，都读到这样的记载；特别是在马太福音28章18到20节，以及使徒行传1章8节，他传递给门徒的大使命更是清楚显明这点。在这两次的委任授命里，耶稣命令跟随他的人，要去使万国万民作他的门徒，并且要作他的见证，直到地极。

当然，耶稣也在国家的层面上鼓励人们要对 上帝忠信。正如在国际层面上，耶稣在外邦人当中的工作，他也在以色列国境内，借着宣讲福音，劝勉人们要对 上帝忠信。他从一个城镇到另一个，传讲因着 上帝的国临近了，命令人要悔改，离开他们的罪，转向对 上帝忠诚。马太福音4章17节，马太如此总结耶稣的传道：

<div class = "quote">
    从那时候，耶稣就传起道来，说：天国近了，你们应当悔改！（马太福音4章17节）
</div>

我们在马可福音1章15节，路加福音5章32节，10章13节，也读到类似的记载。而且在四卷福音书里，有多处提到耶稣传讲这样的信息。

<div class = "quote">
    耶稣如此强调人要对 上帝忠信，他这样做，因为忠信表明信靠。它表明真正认识到 上帝配得我们对他忠信、信靠、顺服，最重要的，还有委身。你不顺服医生的命令时，你不仅仅是在表明你对这些命令的看法，你是在表明对医生的态度。你不顺服 上帝的时候，你不仅仅只是在表明你不理会他的命令，你还是在表明对颁布这些命令的 上帝的看法。所以忠信是表明信靠，表明按 上帝的所是来看他，当然也是要按他的所言来行事。这样，忠信于 上帝，就是表明顺服。表明天天向他委身，按他的所是来信靠他。保罗在罗马书中讲到，在他使徒的事奉中，基督徒人生就是应当带领人顺服真道的人生。这是很美的表达，在一些方面概括了基督徒人生。我们按 上帝的所是看待他，我们把我们的信心放在他身上，这会很自然地导致顺服。我们顺服我们信靠的那一位 上帝。（埃瑞克•索尼斯博士）
<br>
    忠信是耶稣赐给我的，是与他同行，亲密认识他带来的喜乐。但他也要我每天回应他。他不是强迫我顺服他，他不是要我遵从一条律法。他说，不管今天你情绪如何，不管你觉得这世界变得如何，是好还是坏，我需要一颗忠信的心，我需要一位忠信的新妇，我需要一位忠信的仆人，我需要一位忠信爱我自己的心上人。我想这就是他对像我这样的人，倾向用世界的眼光定义属灵的人提出的要求。主说，他要求的比这深入得多，「我要的是一颗忠信的心。」 就像结婚的夫妇，那是真爱的基础。不管发生什么都保持忠信。同样，主要求人忠信，但他也通过他圣灵的同在，使人能成为忠信。（比尔•乌瑞博士）
</div>

我们已经探讨了耶稣君尊的资格和他作为君王的职责，现在要来看他如何履行旧约对于未来弥赛亚君王的期盼。


期盼

在以色列的历史里，因着君王本身的软弱和罪恶，使得他们无法在 上帝面前履行当尽的职责。即使是像摩西、约书亚、和大卫这样忠诚的领袖们，他们虽然顺服 上帝的律法，也关怀百姓，也无法全然做到 上帝所要求的。他们最多是给国家一个短暂和平稳定的时期。律法的要求实在大过于他们能力所及，使他们无法持久的遵行。对于堕落的人类而言，律法实在是太难全面遵守，以满足 上帝的公义。除此之外，甚至最好的领袖也受制于年龄和死亡，《圣经》多处提到这些问题，例如撒迦利亚书4章6节，使徒行传13章34到39节，希伯来书4章8节，还有罗马书8章3和4节。

旧约里统治 上帝百姓的君王，从未得着 上帝要给祂的百姓的最大祝福。他们无法做到 上帝要求的，他们是软弱堕落的人，然而他们的失败却使人生出盼望， 上帝至终会履行祂与大卫所立的约，差遣一位公义的大卫子孙来拯救祂的子民。这个君王要特别从 上帝的灵得着能力，使得他不会有软弱的人通常有的限制。他能够全然的遵行 上帝的律法，成为大卫家、以色列国和历世历代以来失败的人类的救赎主。耶稣就是 上帝所差派来的这么一位君王。 上帝借着耶稣，这位公义的大卫子孙，弥赛亚，最后为人类完成了我们自己本身根本无法做成的事。

我们要从耶稣王权的四个方面，来看耶稣如何达到旧约的这些期盼。第一，我们要看耶稣如何复兴大卫王朝；第二，我们要着重于他给予百姓的自由和得胜；第三，我们要思考耶稣所带来的永恒国度；第四，我们要专注于那个国度的普世性质。让我们先来看耶稣复兴大卫王朝。


大卫王朝

新约《圣经》多处明确证实，耶稣就是预言所说的，要复兴大卫王朝的那一位大卫子孙。被圣灵感动的《圣经》作者们在马太福音1章1节，路加福音3章31节，还有罗马书1章3节，点出这个重要的联结。使徒保罗在使徒行传13章22和23节，特别宣讲这个真理。耶稣在马太福音21章15和16节，启示录3章7节，和22章16节，也宣告他自己就是那位弥赛亚大卫子孙。这证明耶稣的确就是所预言的大卫子孙，是要来的弥赛亚君王，他会达成 上帝为万物所定的国度旨意。

身为大卫宝座的继承人，耶稣要达成 上帝的国度计划首先要作的，就是在以色列国里复兴一群忠信的剩余子民，也就是忠诚于他的使徒和门徒们。就如耶稣在马太福音28章19和20节所命定的，这些跟随他的人要借着传讲福音，使他们所到之处的以色列人和外邦人都成为主的门徒，以此扩展他们的阵容，那些被带出来的门徒们又继续前进，造就更多的门徒，这个过程就从那时起持续至今，使得 上帝在地上的国度现在包含世上极大比例的人口，几乎每个族群或是国家都有 上帝的子民。

耶稣也达成旧约所期盼的，给予那些忠诚于他的人自由和得胜。


自由和得胜

耶稣在地上的年日里，他定意要征服那些属灵的仇敌，例如罪恶、死亡和鬼魔，好让他的百姓得到自由。马太福音1章21到23节，天使对约瑟如此说道：

<div class = "quote">
    （主的使者对约瑟说：） 「她将要生一个儿子，你要给他起名叫耶稣，因他要将自己的百姓从罪恶里救出来。」.这一切的事成就是要应验主藉先知所说的话，说：「必有童女怀孕生子；人要称他的名为以马内利。」 （以马内利翻出来就是「 上帝与我们同在」）。（马太福音1章21-23节）
</div>

在这段经文里，马太将耶稣的出生，与以赛亚书7章14节所讲的，名为以马内利的孩子相提并论。

在以赛亚的预言里，以马内利这个孩子是个兆头，象征 上帝这位勇敢的君王在战争中与祂的子民一起，祂为他们争战，要打败他们的仇敌，得到胜利，使他们从受压制中得到自由。这样的引申使得耶稣极其特别，他就是先知所预言的， 上帝要使用的君王，去为他的百姓争战，打败最大的仇敌，就是罪恶。我们在约翰福音8章36节看到同样的主题，耶稣在那里说只有他能够使人脱离罪，得到真自由。

耶稣也使得他的子民胜过死亡。保罗在罗马书6章4到9节，哥林多前书15章54到57节，讲到这点，他强调耶稣的复活，是为我们击败罪恶和死亡。虽然现今在某个层面上，罪恶和死亡仍然是我们面临的问题，我们依然会犯罪，而且我们的肉体也会死亡，然而我们其实已经是胜过这两个仇敌，因为它们再也没有能力可以掌控我们，使我们被定罪。

对于鬼魔，情况也是类似。身为我们伟大的君王，耶稣已经打败它们，把得胜交给我们。它们虽然还会搅扰或是诱惑我们，甚至在肉体上伤害我们，但是它们已经没有能力来挟制我们，或是毁坏我们的灵魂。歌罗西书2章15节，保罗如此描述耶稣已经胜过鬼魔：

<div class = "quote">
    既将一切执政的、掌权的掳来，明显给众人看，就仗着十字架夸胜。（歌罗西书2章15节）
</div>

当耶稣再回来的时候，他要彻底摧毁每一个抵挡他和他子民的仇敌。即使在现今，他对那些给我们最大伤害的仇敌已经执行初步的审判，为了要确保我们可以脱离它们的掌控，得到自由。

耶稣达到旧约对于君王的第三个期盼是他要建立一个永恒的国度。


永恒的国度

旧约预言说这位应许的君王会开始一个存留到永远的国度，那是地上的天国，在大卫家的君王统治下存到永远。新约证明耶稣的统治是会持续到永远，我们在马太福音19章28和29节，25章34节，路加福音1章33节，希伯来书1章8到13节等经文里看到这样的描述。然而这个国度现今在那里？耶稣是否真的达成这个期盼？还是我们仍然在等候他做成这事？

<div class = "quote">
    耶稣在地上事奉时完成的其中一样事情，就是在地上建立 上帝的国。这看起来是指耶稣通过一个 上帝大能的举动，在敌占区建立起一个滩头阵地，开始了入侵攻势，结局就是把这个星球恢复给它理当拥有的创造主、主人和君王。这对敌占区开始的攻势，显明在几个引人注目的方面：挑战体制化的邪恶，挑战魔鬼的邪恶，用光明和真理驱散欺骗，它大有能力引入另外一种效忠。这场战役仍在进行，还要有打扫战场的行动，清理，消灭最后的顽固堡垒。留待战胜的最后那个敌人就是死亡。因此，就在我们靠着圣灵的能力加入这场正在进行的国度战役的时候，我们仍旧祷告愿你的国降临，愿你的旨意成就。仍有一些事情，我们需要超自然的帮助才能做成。（戈兰•斯高靳博士）
<br>
    为了实现旧约的盼望， 上帝拯救人作王的统治已经借着耶稣基督突入这个世界，在他的受死、他的复活上达到顶点，他的复活证明他的死已经得胜。罪已经被解决，作为罪的工价后果的死亡已经被击败了。他不仅复活，还荣耀的升天，现在坐在 上帝右边。他在五旬节把圣灵浇灌下来。这一切都是国度临到的一部分，我们称为「国度的开启。」它现在就在这地上。然而，我们的主耶稣基督也告诉我们，还有将来的事情。我们仍然祷告。请想一想主祷文，我们祷告说，「愿你的国降临。」 国度已经降临，他已经得胜，国度仍然在等候它的圆满成就。（司提反•威乐姆博士）
<br>
    人最难理解，特别是犹太人最难理解的其中一件事，就是弥赛亚耶稣第一次来和再来之间的关系。可以理解的是，人会说，我们看不到狮子与羔羊一同躺卧，人把刀打成犁头，我们看不到地上有和平，人们以善意相待，那么耶稣怎么可能是弥赛亚，已经应验了对弥赛亚的期望？怎么可能弥赛亚已经来了呢？我们把这称为开启了的末世。这意思就是末世的现实已经随着耶稣第一次降临被带入历史。它们已经开启，它们已经以决断的方式起动开始，但它们仍在实现的过程中，直到最终这些事实得完满的那一点。这被称作是已然和未然的国度。国度已经降临，耶稣已经把它带来了，他已经在争战中发出决定的一击，但战斗仍在继续，仍在等待一个将来的、最终的实现来到。（埃瑞克•索尼斯博士）
</div>

耶稣在他升到天上的宝座之前，的确已经建立一个属他的弥赛亚国度。马太福音12章28节的经文里，耶稣讲到他有能力赶出鬼魔，这就证明他已经把 上帝的国带到世上。赶鬼不是象征着 上帝的国正在来临，而是证明国度已经显现于耶稣的能力里，这个君王正在驱逐他的仇敌。虽然许多学者反对，认为国度没有按着许多人预期可见的方式来到，耶稣却坚持，若是以传统政治权力的观点，来衡量国度的具体显现，那是一个错误的追求。路加福音17章20和21节，耶稣告诉法利赛人说：

<div class = "quote">
    上帝的国来到不是眼所能见的。人也不得说：看哪，在这里！看哪，在那里！因为 上帝的国就在你们心里。（路加福音17章20-21节）
</div>

最后，耶稣达成旧约对于大卫家君王的第四个期盼是，建立一个普世性的国度。


普世性的国度

当耶稣再回来的时候，全地会更新，成为他国度的一部分，而且他的权能和统治也会取代世上所有的政权。在目前，他普世的治理主要是属灵的，就如我们在以弗所书1章21和22节读到的。但是当他再来的时候，他的统治也包含整个物质界。启示录21和22章描绘出一幅新天新地的荣耀画面，在那里，耶稣以君王的身份从他的京城新耶路撒冷统管全球。

新约清楚讲到耶稣就是人们长久期盼的弥赛亚君王，要将 上帝的国带到世上的那位大卫子孙。耶稣在地上事奉的时候，没有达成所有旧约的预言和期盼，但是他所应验是如此众多，已足以证明他的确就是真的君王；他也向我们保证他必将再来，完成他所开始的工作。到了那一天，他的国度会全然成就 上帝原先对于创造的计划，全世界会成为 上帝地上的国度，不再有罪恶和苦难，满有和平和昌盛，人们在 上帝的面前永远蒙受祝福。

在耶稣是君王的这一课里，我们已经探讨了耶稣君王职份的旧约背景，以及这职份在耶稣身上得以实现。现在要来看我们最后一个主题，耶稣君王职份的现今应用。


四、现今应用

我们可以用许多方式来描述耶稣王权的现今意义，而《威斯敏斯德小要理问答》里，第26题的问与答为我们提供了一个合宜的模式：第26题的提问是：

<div class = "quote">
    耶稣怎样执行君王的职分呢？
</div>

《小教理的回答》是：

<div class = "quote">
    基督执行君王的职分，在于征服我们归向他，统管并保护我们，制服并战胜属他和我们所有的仇敌。
</div>

这个回答是从系统神学的三个传统分类，说明耶稣的王权对我们生命的影响。首先，耶稣征服我们，归属于他，也就是说，他把我们带进他的国度里，使我们不再是他的仇敌，而是他所爱的子民；第二，他统管他的国度，治理并且保护我们；第三，他制服而且至终战胜一切属他和我们的仇敌。

按着威斯敏斯德小要理问答所强调的，我们以三个部份来讨论耶稣君王职份的现今应用。第一，我们要看耶稣如何建造他的国度；第二，我们要思考耶稣统管他的子民这个事实；第三，我们要注意他如何战胜他的仇敌。让我们先来看耶稣如何建造国度。


建造他的国度

我们要从三个方面来看耶稣如何建造他的国度：第一，他工作的目的；第二，他国度在这世上的彰显；第三，耶稣用来建造国度的方法。让我们先来探讨耶稣的作的目的。


目的

《圣经》教导说， 上帝的计划是将全世界变成祂在地上的国度，使得祂在地上的统治能反应天上的情形。我们在马太福音6章10节，读到耶稣教导我们要如此祷告，愿 上帝的国度来到，愿祂的旨意行在地上，如同行在天上。而我们也看到启示录21和22章对于新天新地的描述。因此广义地说，耶稣国度建造的目标就是将世界变成 上帝地上的国度，适合 上帝的居住，也充满全然忠于 上帝的子民。然而若是耶稣的目的是为 上帝而建立一个地上的国度，耶稣又是扮演什么角色呢？我们可以说，即使 上帝是万物至高的君王，祂却是任命耶稣以更直接的方式来统管一切，因此 上帝的国度也可以称为是耶稣的国度。就这方面而言， 上帝好像是古代近东的宗主国王，而耶稣就是臣属国王。因着耶稣致力要让宗主国王欢喜，他会全心全意的成就 上帝的目的。哥林多前书15章24和28节，保罗如此描述耶稣对 上帝的顺服：

<div class = "quote">
    再后，末期到了，那时（基督）既将一切执政的、掌权的、有能的、都毁灭了，就把国交与父 上帝……万物既服了他，那时子也要自己服那叫万物服他的，叫 上帝在万物之上，为万物之主。（哥林多前书15章24-28节）
</div>

身为 上帝的至高臣属国王，耶稣拥有 上帝国度的所有权柄，统管万有。他以权柄制服所有敌对 上帝的仇敌，使万有全归服于 上帝，为的就是要成就 上帝对创造的目的。这个目的对我们而言有什么意义？现今的基督徒如何回应耶稣的这个国度目标，就是将全地变成 上帝在地上的国度呢？简单来说，我们也应该以 上帝的国度为我们生活的目标。不管我们有那些其它的目标，也许是谋生，供养我们的家庭，保持健康，接受教育等等，我们追求这些目标，为的都是要拓展 上帝的国度。马太福音6章33节，耶稣教导我们：

<div class = "quote">
    你们要先求（ 上帝的）国和他的义，这些东西都要加给你们了。（马太福音6章33节）
</div>

我们要谈到耶稣建造国度的第二个层面，就是这个国度在世上的彰显。


彰显

历代的许多神学家都注意到，当新约《圣经》谈到耶稣国度在现今的彰显时，它往往将国度与教会紧密联系起来。国度与教会之间的关系在《圣经》许多地方都有描述，包括以弗所1章19节到2章20节和启示录1章4到6节。举例来说，马太福音16章16到19节，彼得和耶稣有这样的对话：

<div class = "quote">
    西门彼得回答说：「你是基督，是永生 上帝的儿子。」 耶稣对他说：「西门巴约拿，你是有福的！因为这不是属血肉的指示你的，乃是我在天上的父指示的。我还告诉你，你是彼得，我要把我的教会建造在这盘石上；阴间的权柄不能胜过他。我要把天国的钥匙给你，凡你在地上所捆绑的，在天上也要捆绑；凡你在地上所释放的，在天上也要释放。」（马太福音16章16-19节）
</div>

这段经文至少从三个方面讲到国度与教会的密切关系。首先，耶稣说，我要建造我的教会。接着这个陈述，他说他要把天国的钥匙给彼得。注意这里的关联：使徒彼得作为教会根基的一部分，他将拥有天国的权柄。

第二个突显出国度和教会关系的细节，在于彼得把基督的职分用在耶稣身上。「基督」一词意思是「受膏者」。这是特指用油膏抹君王标志着他们拥有王权。因此，透过称呼耶稣是基督，彼得正在认定耶稣就是所预言的、大卫家族的君王。因此，耶稣要在他君王的职分上建立教会。

第三个在马太福音16章16到19节的细节，在于它指出国度与教会密切相关之处，就是耶稣让教会投入为天国与阴间或「地狱」的争战。

这些细节都指出这个事实，耶稣和彼得都认为教会和国度是彼此紧密相关的概念。但是，即使教会和国度有如此紧密地关系，在新约《圣经》中它们毕竟不是完全等同的概念。多数学者们的共识是国度的概念远大于教会。

    教会和 上帝国度之间关系的问题，是一个很有意思的问题。 上帝的国度是一个宏观的异象，让万物复兴甘心顺服 上帝完美的旨意。这个异象涵括整个宇宙，肯定涵括这个星球和人类社会，它是顺服那位君王，这种顺服要生出一种令人难以置信的生命平安，就像当初为了 上帝的荣耀和我们极大的喜乐而设立的平安一样。教会则是 上帝选择来推动这个宏观异象而使用的其中一个主要工具。很重要的是，我们不该把教会，肯定不应该把教会的宗教架构等同于国度，它们不是同一回事，而是它们的关系是手段和目的的关系。还有，教会应当像山上的一座城，按此说法，已经显明它自己的内在生命和社会动力，正是这动力，有一天要成为 上帝整个受造界，从这海直到那海的特征。我们既要成为扩展国度的行动者，也要成为国度的原型样板。（戈兰•斯高靳博士）
<br>
    基督徒要全面了解我们在人生每一个层面中该如何生活，就绝不可缺少对 上帝国度和教会这两个概念的认识。但是，我认为很要紧的是知道两者之间的分别。我想很多基督徒，包括我多年以来，都是想，嗯，教会就是某种好像国度高潮的事情，所以我们是那种正在发生最重要的事。但是，在整本《圣经》中，国度的概念要比教会大得多。所以我的看法，我认为也是《圣经》的看法，是把教会看作是国度不可替代的一部分，但它是国度工作中的一部分。 上帝的国度，他的王权，一直都是现实的基础。他是宇宙掌权的主，整个受造界的主，我们的主。他是万族、万民、万方、万王的主。大部分人并不认识到这一点，但他确实是这样的主。所以 上帝的国， 上帝的掌权，是整本《圣经》最大的主题。我们希望教会是已经顺服耶稣主权的人，承认他王权的主权，顺服他，在这世界上为他做工。（比尔•乌瑞博士）
</div>

新约《圣经》表明在基督第一次降临时， 上帝在被造界掌权的最后荣耀阶段就开始了。从那时起， 上帝在地上的国度就继续扩展，使不同层面的人类文化顺服 上帝。最终，当基督再来时， 上帝国度必将不可阻挡地全面得胜，定要在自然界和人类文化的每一个层面里，从头到尾、完全彻底的显明出来。

可是，教会是怎样配合这个历史的轨迹呢？基本而言，教会是现今世代 上帝国度在地上的核心。现在我们奉献我们自己扩展 上帝的国度。当基督再来时，我们将承受国度的完美福分。直到那日为止，我们都要透过教导他命令的一切，传扬基督的福音，目的是把 上帝彰显掌权的领域，在基督返回之前，最大限度地拓展到人类社会的每一个层面。

<div class = "quote">
    很要紧的是教会认识到它在国度中的位置。当耶稣将来再来，我们去与他同在的时候，我认为 上帝不是指着我们说我们是教会，我想那将是国度。新妇为新郎预备好，那是《圣经》另外一个非常重要的画面。我这样说的原因，我认为是有时作为教会，我们太高看自己。我们认为我们是唯一的答案，或者是 上帝唯一的目的，我们非常非常重要。他为教会死了，他死，献上自己，但他也为世界死了。所以我看自己是耶稣基督的教会成员的最好方法，就是说，我有一个目标，就是要成为基督的身体。我要被称作是为这世界作他的手脚，作他臂膀的人，就像他真的在这里一样。这就是我的君王对我，对作为教会的我们的命令。我想令人难过的是，有时教会说，我们是国度的高潮，所以我们是他来做事的目的，所以我们要坐下来，什么也不做，或者只是享受他的同在 ，直到他再来就好了。我想这个观点是错误的，我们需要纠正自己，重新回到把教会的目的和我们的主和救主作王的目的联系起来的任务当中。（比尔•乌瑞博士）
</div>

我们已经探讨了耶稣建造国度的目的，和这个国度的彰显，现在要来看耶稣建造这个国度的方法。


方法

耶稣主要以两种方法来建造他的国度，都是直接参以在教会中，既增添更多的子民，也扩展其地理的疆界。在新约里，耶稣开始时所召聚的人主要是来自以色列，但在他升天的时候，他指示教会要扩展他的国度，从犹大、撒马利亚，直到地极，就是我们在使徒行传1章6到8节所读到的。耶稣的国度建造也透过教会的扩张，去包括世上所有的族裔。身为教会的成员，我们应该如何回应并且参与耶稣的工作？大体而言，我们可以从马太福音28章19和20节，耶稣给予的大使命里找到答案：

<div class = "quote">
    你们要去，使万民作我的门徒，奉父、子、圣灵的名给他们施洗。凡我所吩咐你们的，都教训他们遵守。（马太福音28章19-20节）
</div>

我们在此看到，耶稣用来建造他国度的主要方法就是传扬福音，为人施洗，以及教导《圣经》。耶稣并不是单枪匹马的去执行这些方法，而是分派他的教会，代表他去做这些事情。传扬福音会带领人归信主，为人施洗，使他们归入教会；教导他们《圣经》能够帮助他们生命成长，可以坚固教会，并且能够继续扩展。

<div class = "quote">
    福音书结束时给我们的挑战，就是我们要到万民那里去，传扬好消息和使人作门徒。作门徒这个说法，包含的意思比仅仅作学生更多，比仅仅作信徒更多，它还包含着与 上帝建立一种关系的意思。没错， 上帝要教导我们，没错， 上帝要带领我们，但是使人作门徒的挑战，就是要人一生都在 上帝面前作学徒，与他建立关系，所以需要效法好的榜样。因此，我认为人需要与其他能让他们看到如何好好活出基督徒人生的人建立关系。很明显这也需要教导。人需要明白 上帝对跟从他的人，他的门徒的要求。但我认为这也应该放在教会中，因为 上帝是在教会里设置了供人作为基督徒成长的框架，真正成为终身学习的人，套用那句话说，那些与 上帝建立关系的人，必忠心跟从他。（西门•沃伯特博士）
</div>

我们讨论了耶稣国度建造的现今应用，现在要来看他如何在这个国度里统管他的百姓。


统管他的百姓

我们要从两方面来看耶稣如何统管他的百姓。第一，我们要着重于他为他们的好处而治理他们；第二，我们要看他如何保护他们，不受仇敌攻击。让我们先来看耶稣如何治理他的百姓。


治理

耶稣的治理是专注于让我们得到永恒的益处，就是那些我们会永远与他一起享有的祝福。每一个归向他的人都会领受怜悯和赦免，就如我们在约翰福音6章35到37节，7章37节，10章28和29节，还有使徒行传5章31节所讲到的。他收养我们成为 上帝的儿女，与我们分享他借着全然顺服而得着的所有圣约的祝福。我们从使徒行传13章34到39节，罗马书8章17和32节，还有希伯来书2章13节，读到耶稣的这些治理。除此以外，他也将这些祝福作为恩典的礼物赐给我们，就如我们在约翰福音1章16节，和以弗所书2章8和9节，以及许多其他经文所读到的。

基督恩典慈爱的统治也在今世带给我们现今的益处，就是他借着圣灵所给予我们的，这是记载在使徒行传2章33节，加拉太书4章6节，还有腓立比书1章19节等经文里。他在《圣经》里给予我们清楚的指引，使得我们能够忠诚的服事他，如同我们在哥林多前书9章21节，加拉太书6章2节，还有歌罗西书3章16节所读到的。耶稣也任命教会里的领袖，给予他们权柄和能力去服事他的百姓，就如哥林多前书12章28节，还有以弗所书4章11和12节所提到的。

君王耶稣不是一个无情的独裁者，他是一个慈爱的君王，关怀我们，也供应我们的需要。他的统治绝不是带给我们麻烦，乃是恩慈的祝福，要让我们得到今生和永恒的好处。我们也要明确的回应他的统管，为了领受我们的君王给予我们的祝福，我们需要顺服他的治理，服从他的律令，信靠他的怜悯和能力，来胜过我们的失败和困难。当然我们也需要感谢他的带领，为他如此恩待我们而颂赞他。

我们已经谈过耶稣如何统管治理他的子民，现在要来探讨他如何保护我们。


保护

耶稣以许多方式保护信徒们，为了这一课的目的，我们要注重其中的三项，第一，耶稣保护我们，远离试探而犯罪。

身为我们的君王，耶稣在许多方面保守我们，免受试探。例如，他事先会警告我们远离试探，就如马太福音6章13节提到的；他坚固我们去抵挡罪，就如希伯来书2章16节所讲的；他保护我们脱离那些会牢笼我们的情况，确保我们有一条出路，能够避开罪，就如我们在哥林多前书10章13节，和提摩太后书4章18节读到的。

其次，当我们屈服于诱惑的时候，耶稣会保护我们免于罪的败坏。耶稣保守我们不受罪所败坏的一个方式就是当我们犯罪时，管教纠正我们，使得我们不会受控于罪的辖制。耶利米书46章28节，希伯来书12章5到11节，启示录3章19节，还有许多经文都提到这一点。他保守我们免于败坏的另一个方式是，当我们悔改的时候，饶恕我们，洗净我们的罪，就如约翰一书1章9节所讲的。

第三，耶稣会保护我们，不受罪的指控。所有的基督徒都可能会犯罪，当我们犯罪时，撒旦就会设法要 上帝给我们定罪，就如我们在启示录12章10节读到的。但是耶稣保护我们免受这些指控，使得 上帝能够看我们是全然公义的。虽然《圣经》时常提到基督以祭司的身份为我们代祷，罗马书8章34节却是指出那也是君王职责的一部分。身为伟大的臣属君王，耶稣借着为我们向宗主国王的代求，以此保守他的子民免受控诉。

因着耶稣大力的保守我们，我们与罪恶抗争时可以坦然无惧。如果我们是靠着他的力量抵挡诱惑；靠着他的饶恕，来洁净我们脱离罪的影响；也靠着他的代求，保守我们免除罪的后果；那么就没有什么可以伤害我们的。耶稣是大能勇敢的君王，他带领我们与罪恶抗争。即使我们打不好，我们也不会失败，因为他不会让我们如此。他总是持守着保护我们，赦免并洁净我们，捍卫并释放我们。至终他还要将我们带入他永恒国度那无尽的祝福里。

我们已经谈过了耶稣如何治理他的百姓，现在要来探讨他如何制服他的仇敌。


制服他的仇敌

当 上帝的律法被触犯的时候，许多人就会受到伤害。每天我们看到不同的罪行在发生，有的人被抢劫，被欺诈，被殴打，被出卖，甚至被杀戮。按《圣经》所说的，这些犯了罪行的刑事犯就是受害者和 上帝的仇敌，政府的合宜反应就是要逮捕并且惩治这些犯法的人，他们承受的审判，是按着他们所犯的事件而得惩罚，这么作是要保护那些受害者以及整体社会不再受到这样的伤害。《圣经》的箴言20章8节，和25章5节都讲到这一点。

耶稣所作的审判也类似如此。他是按着公正，就是照着他们罪行所当得的，惩罚我们的和他的仇敌。但他惩罚那些仇敌，也是一个对我们施恩与祝福的举动，为了保护我们免受他们罪恶和暴力的伤害，也要洁净和保守整个世界。这就是为什么在耶稣要把全世界变成 上帝地上国度的这个使命里，清除并且审判罪人是这么的重要；因为只有把罪的败坏彻底除去，才可以使全地成为让 上帝欢喜，适合祂居住的所在，也让我们可以承受永远的祝福。

我们之前谈到，耶稣在世上服事的时候已经开始对他和我们的仇敌施行审判，这些仇敌包括罪恶、死亡和鬼魔。耶稣胜过这些仇敌是必然的，但他还没有全然惩罚它们。因此，在现今的世代，耶稣继续对它们施行审判。而当他再回来的时候，就会完成对它们的判决。彼得后书2章4节，犹大书6节，和启示录20章10和14节，都教导了这个事实。

但是耶稣和他的教会还有其它的仇敌，每个不愿顺服基督的罪人都是撒旦国度的子民，也是 上帝的敌人。《圣经》清楚的讲到这点，例如马太福音13章37到43节，路加福音19章27节，还有以弗所书2章1到3节等。

在现今世代，耶稣只对部份的仇敌在他们还在世上的时候给予部份的审判，例如使徒行传12章23节的希律被虫咬死，因为他让人民把他当 上帝看待。对绝大多数的仇敌，耶稣仍然宽容等候，延迟他的判决，直到他再次返回的时候。

<div class = "quote">
    很有意思的是，《圣经》经常把将来的审判说成是新约《圣经》所传福音的一部分。在本来是好消息的里面，这可能看起来是一个很奇怪的组成部分。但事实就是，这是福音的一部分。它是福音一部分的原因，就是 上帝保证，正如受苦不会永远持续，而是要得到医治，同样， 上帝不会容许不公义无限持续下去，而是必要伸冤。每一个人内心都有一种深切的盼望，盼望不公义的事不能永远得胜，不会随着我们前行，被当成不重要的抛在身后。这是 上帝对受屈的人安慰的应许，这类的事将会有个了断。他们有一位中保，他们无需自己出去参加某种报复的自卫队，自行解决公义的问题，而是把自己和一切交托给一位终将秉行公义，信实的审判主。（戈兰•斯高靳博士）
</div>

使徒们很清楚知道耶稣君王的统治包括了将来的审判，那时每个人都要对耶稣的规则和律法作出回应。使徒行传17章31节，罗马书14章10到12节，还有希伯来书10章26到31节，都讲到末日的审判。这将要来的审判大日是基督君王职责的一个重要部份，因为他要按公义审判罪人，对信徒施怜悯，并且洁净 上帝的国度，以显示对 上帝的忠诚信实。

对于那些还没有接受基督为主的人，末日审判可能是个可怕的信息，但那未必不是一件好事。这些警告让未信的人有机会为罪而悔改，因此得以从我们的君王耶稣基督那里领受饶恕、怜悯和恩典。的确，末日的审判是很震撼人心的信息，但其中心的意义是要让悔改的人得着祝福。事实上，这也是为什么《圣经》讲到福音的时候，经常包含日后审判的警告，例如马太福音21章32到44节，还有使徒行传17章30和31节。

<div class = "quote">
    我想许多基督徒有时会因着《圣经》中的描写和呈现的福音感到困惑，这些描写和呈现包括了对不悔改，不在基督里，死在他们罪中的人，要受毁灭性、永远惩罚的信息。我想我对这个问题有更清楚一点的认识，那就是医生当着我的面说，「我们发现你身上有肿瘤。」这听起来不像是好消息，但是你知道这实际上是好消息。医生找到了肿瘤，这是好消息。他把这件事告诉我，这是好消息。如果医生认为，他把我长了肿瘤的事告诉我，这不好，那么情况会怎么样呢？那不是有爱心的做法，那没有恩慈，那并不友好。他发现了肿瘤，他告诉我，「这是实情，你有肿瘤，这会要你的命。但我们能对它做一些治疗。」所以这是好消息。你是知道的，《圣经》如此清楚地讲了将来的审判，还有罪的后果。我们知道那是好消息。这是好消息，也是因为它彰显了 上帝的荣耀。《圣经》不是对我们说，有审判要来，顺便说一句，这是神无法制止要发生的事。《圣经》告诉我们，这是 上帝的义和他的公义、他的圣洁倾注而出的要求。所以，我们提前知道这一点，好叫我们逃向基督，避免将来的毁灭，将来的审判，这就是好事。但是，你也知道，当你来看到新约《圣经》结束的几章书，来看到启示录的时候，《圣经》讲得很坦白，就是 上帝无论是在拯救被赎之人，还是把审判倾注在不悔改之人身上，都显出他的荣耀。当我们看这一点，我们就要认识到，当 上帝向在基督里罪得赦免，不是靠自己功德得赦免的人，也向那些到最后顽固拒绝他的人，同时显出他的义的时候， 上帝的荣耀就最完美、无限地彰显出来。事实就是我们需要明白这一点。福音是好消息，这首先是因为它告诉我们怎样逃离将来的毁灭，我们怎样能够信靠基督，在他里面，找到永生。但是它是好消息，也是因为我们需要知道故事的其余部分，那也是福音的一部分。（奥尔伯特•穆勒博士）
</div>

《圣经》对于最后审判的教导，应该很能鼓舞信徒的心志，那让我们深切明白我们的受苦绝不是徒然的。每个错误至终都要被矫正，如同我们在雅各书5章7和8节，还有帖撒罗尼迦后书1章4到10节所读到的。基督的审判值得我们称颂，因为那会摧毁所有罪恶的存在、影响和败坏，使得世界成为圣洁美好，我们可以永久居住之地。启示录14章7节，天使如此宣告：

<div class = "quote">
    应当敬畏 上帝，将荣耀归给他！因他施行审判的时候已经到了。应当敬拜那创造天地海和众水泉源的。（启示录14章7节）
</div>

五、总结

在这一课里，我们探讨了耶稣的君王职份。我们思考了这个职份的旧约背景，就是君王的资格、职责和未来的期盼。我们也看到这个职份的每个部份都在耶稣身上得着实现。我们还探讨了耶稣王权的现今应用，就是耶稣如何建造他的国度，如何治理他的百姓，以及制服他的仇敌。

在这个系列里，我们查考了关乎基督的丰富教义。我们看到耶稣是历世历代的救赎者，我们探讨了他的生平和事奉，以及他承担的先知、祭司和君王的职份。我们对于耶稣的认识，绝不能只是学术的认知，而是认识耶稣到底是谁，以及他对自己所作的启示，在于能够培养我们一生对他的敬爱和顺从。我们领受这些教训，存记在心，有助于我们在阅读《圣经》，教会中敬拜，事奉别人中，还有持守与主耶稣基督的关系上，都能有清楚宝贵的领悟与看见。
