# Hymn

1  
When I survey the wondrous cross  
on which the Prince of glory died,  
my richest gain I count but loss,  
and pour contempt on all my pride.

2   
Forbid it, Lord, that I should boast  
save in the death of Christ, my God!  
All the vain things that charm me most,  
I sacrifice them through his blood.

3   
See, from his head, his hands, his feet,  
sorrow and love flow mingled down.  
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet,  
or thorns compose so rich a crown? 

4   
Were the whole realm of nature mine,  
that were a present far too small.  
Love so amazing, so divine,  
demands my soul, my life, my all.

## Fruit of thoughts:  
I assume we have not sung this hymn for a long time.  This hymn includes many poetic devices, one of them is an oxymoron.  Oxymoron is found twice in the first stanza.  "my richest gain I count but loss",  and "pour contempt on all my pride". Isaac Watt counted everything as insignificant compared to the wondrous cross.  

The theme in the first stanza aligns with the scriptures of Jeremiah 9:23-24 KJV. Allow me to read it to you.

<div class = "quote">
‪Jeremiah‬ 9:23-24 NLT
<br>23 This is what the Lord says: “Don’t let the wise boast in their wisdom, or the powerful boast in their power, or the rich boast in their riches.    
<br>24 But those who wish to boast should boast in this alone: that they truly know me and understand that I am the Lord who demonstrates unfailing love and who brings justice and righteousness to the earth, and that I delight in these things. I, the Lord, have spoken!
</div>

Without a doubt, God's wisdom and God's power are beyond our imagination.  The whole universe is his; therefore, we can't measure his richness.  When comparing the differences between worldly wisdom and God's wisdom, I just make two comparisons.   

1) Worldly wisdom provides solutions to deal with symptoms of human problems individually.  God provides one solution for all problems because the common root cause of problems is our sins.  He requests people to repent.   

2) Worldly wisdom offer solutions to improve and modify the old creature, God's solution is to have us nail our selfish nature on the cross, then He gave us new life. The purpose of the cross is not to destroy us, but rebuild us. As Galatians 2:20 KJV says, 

<div class = "quote">

Galatians 2:20 NLT  
20 My old self has been crucified with Christ. It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me. So I live in this earthly body by trusting in the Son of God, who loved me and gave himself for me.
</div>


And what is more, Ephesians 1:3 KJV says this: 
<div class = "quote">
Ephesians 1:3 NLT
The father of our Lord Jesus Christ has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.  
</div>

Isn't it wonderful? Because we are His children, we have all spiritual blessings. He did not hold any blessings back.  What he has, I already have them all; you already have them all.     

The more blessings I discover at the personal level and the church level, the more I love Jesus.



## Reflection

Let us pause for a minute and return to the hymn. How do you reflect on the wondrous cross? How do you love Jesus? We are going to have a quiet moment to facilitate that. After that, I am going to pray for the bread.

## Prayer  

Heavenly father, when we survey the wondrous cross today, It reminds us that you adopted us in advance into your family by bringing us to yourself through Jesus Christ.  You purchased our liberty with the sacrifice of your Son.  Your love is so amazing, so divine, that we offer our soul, our life, all of us to worship you.  Your Son is worthy of our remembrance.  In the name of Jesus Christ, we pray. Amen!

# Other Thoughts

I want to remind us that we were sealed with the holy spirit upon we trust Him (Ephesian 1:13 KJV translation says so).  

He based this hymn on the Scriptural reference of Galatians 6:14 ASV.  

<div class = "quote">
Galatians ‬6:14 NLT
<br>14 As for me, may I never boast about anything except the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ. Because of that cross, my interest in this world has been crucified, and the world’s interest in me has also died.

‪Ephesians‬1:3-14 NLT
<br>3 All praise to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenly realms because we are united with Christ.   
<br>4 Even before he made the world, God loved us and chose us in Christ to be holy and without fault in his eyes.   
<br>5 God decided in advance to adopt us into his own family by bringing us to himself through Jesus Christ. This is what he wanted to do, and it gave him great pleasure.   
<br>6 So we praise God for the glorious grace he has poured out on us who belong to his dear Son.   
<br>7 He is so rich in kindness and grace that he purchased our freedom with the blood of his Son and forgave our sins.   
<br>8 He has showered his kindness on us, along with all wisdom and understanding.  
<br>9 God has now revealed to us his mysterious will regarding Christ — which is to fulfill his own good plan.   
<br>10 And this is the plan: At the right time he will bring everything together under the authority of Christ — everything in heaven and on earth.   
<br>11 Furthermore, because we are united with Christ, we have received an inheritance from God, for he chose us in advance, and he makes everything work out according to his plan.  
<br>12 God’s purpose was that we Jews who were the first to trust in Christ would bring praise and glory to God.   
<br>13 And now you Gentiles have also heard the truth, the Good News that God saves you. And when you believed in Christ, he identified you as his own by giving you the Holy Spirit, whom he promised long ago.   
<br>14 The Spirit is God’s guarantee that he will give us the inheritance he promised and that he has purchased us to be his own people. He did this so we would praise and glorify him.
</div>

Jesus Christ blessed us with every spiritual blessing.  
He poured out his glorious grace on us.  
He is rich in kindness and grace.
