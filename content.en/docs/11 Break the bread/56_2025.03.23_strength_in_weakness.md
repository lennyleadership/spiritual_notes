# Key verse

歌 林 多 後 書 13:4 CUVS  
他 因 软 弱 被 钉 在 十 字 架 上 ， 却 因 <b>神 的 大 能</b> 仍 然 活 着 。 我 们 也 是 这 样 同 他 软 弱 ， 但 因 神 向 你 们 所 显 的 大 能 ， 也 必 与 他 同 活 。

2 Corinthians 13:4 CSB  
For he was crucified in weakness, but he lives by <b>the power of God</b>. For we also are weak in him, but in dealing with you we will live with him by God's power.

Jesus demonstrated his trait: meekness, submissive.  He yielded to God's will, God's plan - salvation.

Jesus is God.  He demonstrated His power in conducting miracles (healing, calming storm, showing himself to disciples after resurrection).  Were there anything he can't do in the form of human being?  


# The power of God

1 Corinthians 1:18 CSB  
For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is <b>the power of God</b> to us who are being saved.

歌 林 多 前 書 1:18 CUVS  
因 为 十 字 架 的 道 理 ， 在 那 灭 亡 的 人 为 愚 拙 ； 在 我 们 得 救 的 人 ， 却 为 <b>神 的 大 能</b> 。




# Application

歌 林 多 後 書 12:9-11 CUVS
[9] 他 对 我 说 ： 我 的 恩 典 够 你 用 的 ， 因 为 我 的 能 力 是 在 人 的 软 弱 上 显 得 完 全 。 所 以 ， 我 更 喜 欢 夸 自 己 的 软 弱 ， 好 叫 基 督 的 能 力 覆 庇 我 。 
[10] 我 为 基 督 的 缘 故 ， 就 以 软 弱 、 凌 辱 、 急 难 、 逼 迫 、 困 苦 为 可 喜 乐 的 ； 因 我 甚 麽 时 候 软 弱 ， 甚 麽 时 候 就 刚 强 了 。 
[11] 我 成 了 愚 妄 人 ， 是 被 你 们 强 逼 的 。 我 本 该 被 你 们 称 许 才 是 。 我 虽 算 不 了 甚 麽 ， 却 没 有 一 件 事 在 那 些 最 大 的 使 徒 以 下 。

2 Corinthians 12:9-11 CSB
[9] But he said to me, "My grace is sufficient for you, for <b>my power is perfected in weakness</b>." Therefore, I will most gladly boast all the more about my weaknesses, so that Christ's power may reside in me. 
[10] So I take pleasure in weaknesses, insults, hardships, persecutions, and in difficulties, for the sake of Christ. For when I am weak, then I am strong. 
[11] I have been a fool; you forced it on me. You ought to have commended me, since I am not in any way inferior to those "super-apostles," even though I am nothing.

# Reference

So on the one hand, the incarnate Christ in the gospel of John has a divine nature, he’s fully God. On the other hand, there were aspects of his glory which he had <b>laid aside</b>. That’s why he’s praying, “Father, restore to me the glory I had with you before the foundation of the world.” I think that would include at least the privileges of deity that stand between the divine Christ and the shame and degradation and suffering and death of the cross. That’s the point of Philippians 2:5–8. He moved from such height to such shameful degradation on our behalf. And that’s the mind-set we’re supposed to have as we serve others.    

But then, again I need to qualify and say it would be a mistake to say that he laid aside all of the divine glory in becoming man. John 1:14 says, “The Word became flesh and dwelt among us, and we have seen his glory, glory as of the only Son from the Father, full of grace and truth.”   

In his divine nature, he had all the essential attributes of God during his incarnation, and in his human nature, he was finite and could therefore grow in wisdom and stature.
