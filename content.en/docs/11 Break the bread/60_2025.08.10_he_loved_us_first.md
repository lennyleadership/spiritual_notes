Introduction: Fanny Crosby's "Praise".  What is wonderful love? How did Jesus bear my sorrow?

I felt my energy was drained at work. then see what the Bible reading could bring up.  I want to restore my energy.

Song of Songs 1:4 "Draw me away" <---> 1John 4:19 "God love us firstly"

Song of Songs 8:6 "Love is as strong as death" <---> none can separate us from the love of God. <---> Romans 8:35

Apostle Paul was motivated by his love to God.  The love is immeasurable, the love he understood from God.
