What makes minestrone minestrone?

What makes a christian a christian?  A fundamental truth: two substitutions.

“我们与主同钉十字架”出自《加拉太书》2:20，是基督徒灵性身份的核心真理。

加拉太书 2:20 和合本   
20 我已经与基督同钉十字架，现在活着的不再是我，乃是基督在我里面活着；并且我如今在肉身活着，是因信　神的儿子而活；他是爱我，为我舍己。

信徒凭信心领受，靠圣灵活出，每天“算自己已死”（罗6:11），胜过肉体情欲（加5:24），让基督显出生命。真基督徒以此为根基，得胜生活从十字架同钉开始。  

罗马书 6:11 和合本    
11 这样，你们向罪也当看自己是死的；向　神在基督耶稣里，却当看自己是活的。


A true Christian is a person who has put faith and trust in the person and work of Jesus Christ, including His death on the cross as payment for sins and His resurrection on the third day. John 1:12 tells us, “Yet to all who received him, to those who believed in his name, he gave the right to become children of God.” The mark of a true Christian is love for others and obedience to God’s Word (1 John 2:4, 10). A true Christian is indeed a child of God, a part of God’s true family, and one who has been given new life in Jesus Christ.
