<p>The lead character in the Bible is Jesus. Jesus was predicted in the Old Testament, Jesus was revealed in the Gospels, Jesus was preached in the book of Acts, Jesus was explained in the Epistles, Jesus was expected in the book of Revelation.</p>

<p>Genealogy of Jesus and virgin birth. Reveal who Jesus is</p>.

<ul>
<li>Jesus is eligible for kingship by virtue of being the blood descendant of David.</li>

<li>Matthew 1:20. Virgin birth:    
<br>Does it matter?    
<br>
a) Jesus was conceived by the Holy Spirit, therefore, is 100% God and 100% man.  
<br>
<br>b) It is a good thing that Jesus was not a biological son of Joseph. Because Jesus did not get sin from ancestors.  There are two benefits, first of all, Jesus is the blameless, sinless, Pass-over lamb. Secondly, Jesus did not get curse from Jeconiah who was an evil king.  God was outraged with him and judged the royal line with a curse: no descendant of Jechonias would sit as king of Israel. 
<br>This seemingly contradicts the promise that God will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever. (1Chr 22:7-10)<label for="throne" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">1 Chronicles 22:10 NKJV
He shall build a house for My name, and he shall be My son, and I will be his Father; and I will establish the throne of his kingdom over Israel forever.'</span> and also would make Jesus ineligible to the throne, as he was the descendant of Jechonias.  
<br>But, since Jesus was only an adopted son and not biological son of Joseph, the curse did not affect his right to the throne as he was not of Jechonias' seed. This curse also indicates that the Messiah cannot have a human father since then the curse would pass onto him too.
<br>
<br>c) Jesus was the first-born.  
<br>
<br>Conclusion: Jesus was the perfect sacrifice.</li>  
<li>3) Matthew 1:21. The meaning of Jesus, for He will save His people from their sins.
<br>
High Priest
Hebrews 7:20 Jesus was made the High Priest with an oath by God who said to him:
“The Lord has sworn  
And will not relent,  
‘You are a priest forever  
According to the order of Melchizedek’ ”  
<br>
Hebrews 9:11-12. Jesus Christ came as High Pries. He bypassed the sacrifices consisting of goat and calf blood, instead used his own blood as the price to set us free, and went straight into the Most Holy Place once for all.</li> 
</ul>

<p>Salvation ends the old nature, sinful nature, and starts the new life.</p>   

<p>Jesus is the head of royal priesthood. 1 Peter 2:9 We are a chosen generation, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, His own special people, that you may proclaim the praises of Him who called you out of darkness into His marvelous light.</p>
