希伯来书 12:18-24 现代标点  
18 你们原不是来到那能摸的山，此山有火焰、密云、黑暗、暴风、

Hebrews 12:18-24 NKJV
18 For you have not come to the mountain that may be touched and that burned with fire, and to blackness and darkness and tempest,  
19 and the sound of a trumpet and the voice of words, so that those who heard it begged that the word should not be spoken to them anymore.  
20 (For they could not endure what was commanded: “And if so much as a beast touches the mountain, it shall be stoned or shot with an arrow.”  
21 And so terrifying was the sight that Moses said, “I am exceedingly afraid and trembling.”)  
22 But you have come to Mount Zion and to the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem, to an innumerable company of angels,  
23 to the general assembly and church of the firstborn who are registered in heaven, to God the Judge of all, to the spirits of just men made perfect,  
24 to Jesus the Mediator of the new covenant, and to the blood of sprinkling that speaks better things than that of Abel.

May we be like pilgrim, come to worship Him, be still, and remember Him.

These people will get the best.




# 补充材料
眼前看見的一群人，他們正上耶路撒冷守節期，他們是跟從神律法、守節期的人，可能一年有三次這樣上耶路撒冷守節期。他們是先信心、後理性的人，因為上耶路撒冷的路上會有危險，但因是神的律法叫人去守節期，冒著生命危險，離開安樂窩，失去賺錢的機會，甚至被人取笑。很多人都不去守節期了，為何你們要去守節期呢？耶和華不是已經離開你們了嗎？甚至外邦人也取代笑他們：你們的神並沒有保護你們；耶路撒冷聖城現在已經不是你們的首都了，聖殿已被拆毀了。他們可以認為沒有必要再上耶路撒冷去。但詩人說：「看哪，敬畏耶和華的人必要這樣蒙福！」(128:4) 他對這群仍然跟隨神的人說，你必要蒙這樣的福，必要蒙神從錫安賜給你的福。<a href = "https://church611.org/morning_devotion/%E8%A9%A9%E7%AF%87128%E7%AF%87-3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">611灵粮堂 | 詩篇128章</a>
