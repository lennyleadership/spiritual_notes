雅各书 1:15 和合本  
15 <b>私欲</b>既怀了胎，就生出罪来；罪既长成，就生出死来。  
James 1:15 NKJV  
15 Then, when <b>desire</b> has conceived, it gives birth to sin; and sin, when it is full-grown, brings forth death.


以弗所书 4:19 和合本  
19 良心既然丧尽，就放纵私欲，贪行种种的污秽。  
Ephesians 4:19 NKJV 
19 who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lewdness, to work all uncleanness with greediness.


约翰一书 2:16 和合本  
16 因为，凡世界上的事，就像肉体的情欲、眼目的情欲，并今生的骄傲，都不是从父来的，乃是从世界来的。  
1 John 2:16 NKJV  
16 For all that is in the world—the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the pride of life—is not of the Father but is of the world.


加拉太书 5:24 和合本  
24 凡属基督耶稣的人，是已经把肉体连肉体的邪情<b>私欲</b>同钉在十字架上了。  
Galatians 5:24 NKJV  
24 And those who are Christ’s have crucified the flesh with its passions and desires.  



Desire is neutral.  It can be either good or bad.  The bad desire comes from the world.  The good desire comes from God.  

There is desire in unbelievers, as well as in believers.  

Jesus addressed the corrupted desire, besides covering sin.  The corrupted desires have been crucified.
