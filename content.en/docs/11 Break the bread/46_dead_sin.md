Romans 1:18-32  We used to be unrighteous, and were deserving of death.

Romans 2:12 We will perish [sinful, but against the law], we will be judged [sinful and against the law].

The Greek word for sin, hamartia, is a word that means "to miss." Our English word sin comes from a root "to miss." In fact, it comes from a game in archery that the British used to have. They would put a hoop on a pole, and each man would take his quiver of arrows and shoot his arrows through the hoop one at a time. And so maybe you would have five men in the contest. Each of them with ten arrows, and one after another they would shoot their arrow through the hoop there at the top of the pole. Now, if a man should miss the hoop, then he was called a sinner, you have missed. And he would have to treat the rest of the fellows to the drinks. He was a sinner. He had missed the mark. - Chuck Smith

What did we miss? Answer: The new life, the life of God.

> John 1:4 NKJV  
In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.
