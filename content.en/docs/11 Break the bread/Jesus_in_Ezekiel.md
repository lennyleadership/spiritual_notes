## 1. The glory  of Jesus
Encouraging message to Ezekiel in the hard times when they were exiles, captives.

Eze 1:26-28 MKJV
(26)  And from above the expanse that was over their heads was a likeness like a sapphire stone, the likeness of a throne. And on the likeness of the throne was a likeness looking like a man on it from above.  
(27)  And I saw Him looking like the color of polished bronze, looking like fire all around within it. From the likeness of His loins even upward, and from the likeness of His loins even downward, I saw Him, looking like fire, and it had brightness all around.  
(28)  As the bow that is in the cloud in the day of rain looks, so the brightness all around looked. This was how <mark>the likeness of the glory of Jehovah</mark> looked. And I saw. And I fell on my face, and I heard a voice of One speaking.

当神的百姓软弱失败的时候，神却用环绕宝座的彩虹显明了祂永不止息的怜悯。
