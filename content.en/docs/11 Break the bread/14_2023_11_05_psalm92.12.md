Psalm 92:12  Analogy of Jesus' life.

the palm tree isn’t really a tree.

Inner structure:
1) Cut a palm tree down and you’ll see tiny circular vessels distributed evenly throughout the trunk.  The science terms are xylem and phloem.  
2) Palm tree is endogenous plant. grow from inside out.

As a result,  
1) a date palm can still produce fruit when it is 80 years old.  
2) These characteristics make them very resilient and unaffected by seasonal changes. They can survive droughts, floods and storms.  Palm trees are able to bend 40 to 50 degrees without snapping.
