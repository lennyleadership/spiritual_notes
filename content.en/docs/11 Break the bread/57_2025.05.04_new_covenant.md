# Verses 经文 
哥林多后书 3:7-18 CCB  
[7] 这最终带来死亡、刻在石版上的律法条文的事工尚且有荣耀，甚至使摩西的脸上发出荣光，尽管很快就消逝了，以色列人仍然无法定睛看他，   
[8] 那么<b>圣灵的事工</b>岂不<b>更有</b>荣耀吗？   
[9] 那定人罪的事工尚且有荣耀，这使人被称为义人的事工岂不更有荣耀吗？   
[10] 其实先前的荣耀和现今的大荣耀相比，就黯然失色了。   
[11] 那渐渐消逝的尚且有荣耀，这永远长存的更是荣耀无比。   
[12] 我们因为有这极大的盼望，就放胆无惧，   
[13] 不像摩西将<b>帕子</b>蒙在脸上，以免以色列人看见那渐渐消逝的荣光。   
[14] 但以色列人的心刚硬，直到今日，他们每逢读旧约的时候，同样的帕子还在那里，没有揭去。因为只有在基督里，那帕子才能被除去。   
[15] 时至今日，每逢他们读摩西律法的时候，帕子仍然蒙在他们心上。   
[16] 然而，他们一旦归向基督，那帕子就被除去了。   
[17] 主就是那灵，主的灵在哪里，哪里就有自由。   
[18] 我们这些脸上不再蒙着帕子的人，可以像镜子一样反映主的荣光，渐渐变成主的样式，荣上加荣。这都是主的作为，主就是那灵。

2 Corinthians 3:7-18 NET  
[7] But if the ministry that produced death - carved in letters on stone tablets - came with glory, so that the Israelites could not keep their eyes fixed on the face of Moses because of the glory of his face (a glory which was made ineffective),   
[8] how much more glorious will <b>the ministry of the Spirit</b> be?   
[9] For if there was glory in <b>the ministry that produced condemnation</b>, how much more does <b>the ministry that produces righteousness</b> excel in glory!   
[10] For indeed, what had been glorious now has no glory because of the tremendously greater glory of what replaced it.   
[11] For if what was made ineffective came with glory, how much more has what remains come in glory!   
[12] Therefore, since we have such a hope, we behave with great boldness,   
[13] and not like Moses who used to put <b>a veil</b> over his face to keep the Israelites from staring at the result of the glory that was made ineffective.   
[14] But their minds were closed. For to this very day, the same veil remains when they hear the old covenant read. It has not been removed because only in Christ is it taken away.   
[15] But until this very day whenever Moses is read, a veil lies over their minds,   
[16] but when one turns to the Lord, the veil is removed.   
[17] Now the Lord is the Spirit, and where the Spirit of the Lord is present, there is freedom.   
[18] And we all, with unveiled faces reflecting the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from one degree of glory to another, which is from the Lord, who is the Spirit.

Moses face was radiant because he was in God's glory.  The children of the Israelites knew sin in God's glory;  They could not go into God's presence but through the mediator, such as Moses.  Later on God setup priesthood so that priests can take people's sin and put their hands onto a sacrifice so sin was passed to the sacrifice.  The high priest went through the veil into the holy of the holy.    
After Jesus was crucified, the veil was torn down, the holy of the holy was open to everyone who believes in Him.
