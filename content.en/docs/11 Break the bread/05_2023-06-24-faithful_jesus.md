<h1>Fruit for Thought</h1>

I would like to share my meditation on Jesus' faithfulness in Hebrews 3:2. It says who (Jesus) was <b>faithful</b> to Him who appointed him in all God's house....

Let me give you a fruit for thought on how faithfulness was demonstrated.  One time, after Jesus raised Jairus' daughter from the dead, he instructed people to tell no one what had happened (Lk 8:49-56).  In an another time, Jesus said, this generation saught after a sign, but there is no sign other than the sign of Jonas (Lk 11:29-32).  

All signs and wonders were beneficial to the Israelite but God used them to confirm the gospel (Hebrews 2:4). 

Even though he did miraculous signs and wonders, he did not seek glory for himself, he was <b>faithful</b> to his calling, to be sacrificed on the Cross and bring life to everyone who believes in Him.  His faithfulness was demonstrated in the cost of his life, not glory for himself.




<h1>Prayer</h1>

Let us pray.  God you make Jesus the perfect captain of our salvation through his suffering.  He was faithful to you and fulfill what you appointed him to do.  As we partake the bread, we remember his humbleness, his obedience, and his faithfulness.  We pray in Jesus name.
