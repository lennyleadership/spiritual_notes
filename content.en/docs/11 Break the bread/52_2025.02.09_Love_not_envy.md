1 Corinthians 13:4 Love doesn't envy

People usually envy [are jealous of] others who have things they don't, such as job promotion, wealth, marriage, and so on. 
We know Satan was jealous of God, Satan wants to be exalted and lifted up. 
Satan doesn't love us. 
What about God?  Does God envy Satan, or human beings? 
God doesn't need our worship so that he could be exalted even more.
