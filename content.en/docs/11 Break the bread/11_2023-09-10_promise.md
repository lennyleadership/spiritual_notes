2 Peter 1:4 ESV  
by which he has granted to us his precious and very great <b>promises</b>, so that through them you may become <b>partakers</b> of the divine nature, having <b>escaped</b> from the corruption that is in the world because of sinful desire.

Two actions: we escaped from the corruption, then partake the divine nature.

I want to use the meaning of the word "Hebrew". Abraham was called Hebrew in Genesis 14:13.  Hebrew appeared at the first time.  
The root of the word Hebrew means “to pass ” It especially means to pass over a river from one region to another and from one side to another. Abraham was a river crosser. Abraham crossed the Euphrates. 

God is patient, he revealed his plan to the Israelite.  The Israelite history proved that human beings failed to escape from the sin.  We are like the near-dead Jew laying on the side of the road.  Self-help, self-improvement, religion can't help.  There was no hope.  

The promise was translated from the Greek word, The strong number is G1860. It only appear twice in the new testament.

2 Peter 3:13 ESV  
But according to his <b>promise</b> we are waiting for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells.
