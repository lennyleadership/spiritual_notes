Genesis 4:1-7

Hebrews 11:4

# Context
Offering before priesthood, sacrificing system.

God always seek people who worship Him.  

It was a privilege for Abel and Cain. They don't need a mediator.  

God taught Abel and Cain the offering.



# God is righteous

God respected Abel's offering because Abel was faithful.

God is righteous, so he expected Abel and Cain to be righteous when coming to His presence.
Genesis 4:1-5

# God is love
Genesis 4:7 sin lies at the door.

Not by work.
