Genesis 4:1-7

Hebrews 11:4

# Context
Offering before priesthood, sacrificing system.

God always seek people who worship Him.  

It was a privilege for Abel and Cain. They don't need a mediator.  

God taught Abel and Cain the offering.



# God is righteous

God respected Abel's offering because Abel was faithful.

God is righteous, so he expected Abel and Cain to be righteous when coming to His presence.  

Genesis 4:1-5

If we sin against God, and did not get consequence, we thought God is silent, actually we are in trouble.


# God is love

Cain became very angry to God so his face was gloomy.

Genesis 4:7 sin lies at the door.

Difficult verse to be translated.  the word "sin" could be translated as "a sin offering".

Not by work.
