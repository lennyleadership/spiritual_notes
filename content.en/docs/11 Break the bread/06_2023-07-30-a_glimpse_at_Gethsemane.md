Fruit for thought see if you could agree with me.  

Pray in Gethsemane recorded in Gospel of Matthew chapter 26 verse 36 to 45 [Matthew 26:36-45], Gospel of Mark chapter 14, verse 32 to 42 [Mark 14:32-42], and gospel of Luke chapter 22 verse 39 to 46 [Luke 22:39-46]. 

Luke 22:42-44 ESV  
Jesus was sorrowful and troubled.  
[42][He prayed], "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."   
[43] And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.   
[44] And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

We should not think this prayer expressed reluctance or a desire to turn back, we should remember what Jesus said in John 12:27 while Jesus entered Jerusalem for the Passover.

Two evidences to show Jesus come to this hours.
1. John 3:14-15 ESV
[14] [Jesus told Nicodemus] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   
[15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

2. John 12:27 ESV  
[27] [Jesus spoke to the crowd] "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose I have come to this hour."

So, what was going on in Gethsemane? There is a hint. Jesus was sweating blood.  The medical term of such condition is called hematohidrosis. It may occur in an individual who is suffering from extreme levels of stress. [<a href = "<a href = "" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A Curious Case of Sweating Blood</a>]

Some medical reports to this effect stated that when a man is under such intense pressure, such intense turmoil, such intense conflict, if he ever begins to sweat blood, he is close to a mortal stroke, he is close to dropping dead.  What might happen was: the Devil showed up one more time in the life of Jesus and tried to kill him.  That is possible.  Prior to Calvary, the Devil would have stopped Jesus from going to the cross any way he could have, because the Devil knows the cross is his defeat. 


God's plan is to rescue human being from Satan's kingdom.  God sent the God Son, Jesus, to the earth as a man to accomplish the salvation on the Cross. 

However the road to the Cross was not smooth. Satan attempted to destroy the plan.   

<li>King Herod assassins. He killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under.  However God had Joseph takeb Jesus and Mary to Egypt beforehand.</li>
<li>Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness.  Jesus defeated Satan with God's Words.</li>
<li>The religious leaders tried to push Jesus over a cliff</li>.
<li>The crowd picked up stones to stone Him.</li>

Jesus cried out, don't let me die here, spare my life, let me live, let me go to that Cross.




Brothers and sisters, every time when we come and get together around the Lord's table, the moment reminds us what Jesus had done in the days of his flesh.  We don't take God's love for granted. reminds us we should sin less, sin no more, and repent our sins.  

<b>Prayer</b>:  
How precious we are in God's mind! so that God Father sacrificed Jesus, His begotten son.

What spiritual battles God fought against Satan in the days of Jesus flesh! so that  

We appreciate the cost you paid.



<b>Background</b>:  

Our sin can be forgiven by God and we can live when we believe in Jesus.

Jesus became the high priest and the sacrifice.  You washed away our sin, we can come to God directly. -

Jesus was killed on the Day of Preparation of Passover (the following day was the Sabbath, in general Jesus was killed on Passover)
