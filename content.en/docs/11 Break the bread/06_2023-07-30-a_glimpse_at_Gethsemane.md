Fruit for thought  

Pray in Gethsemane recorded in Gospel of Matthew chapter 26 verse 36 to 45 [Matthew 26:36-45], Gospel of Mark chapter 14, verse 32 to 42 [Mark 14:32-42], and gospel of Luke chapter 22 verse 39 to 46 [Luke 22:39-46]. 


God's plan is to rescue human being from Satan's kingdom.  God sent the God Son, Jesus, to the earth as a man to accomplish the salvation on the Cross. 

However the road to the Cross was not smooth. Satan attempted to destroy the plan.   

King Herod killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under.  However Joseph took Jesus and Mary to Egypt beforehand.
Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness.  Jesus defeated Satan with God's Words.

God Our sin can be forgiven by God and we can live when we believe in Jesus.

Jesus' conversation with Nicodemus was recorded in the Gospel of John.  

John 3:14-15 ESV
[14] And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   
[15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.


Prayer:
Jesus became the high priest and the sacrifice.  You washed away our sin, we can come to God directly. -
