Matthew 1:1-25

1) Matthew 1:1-17 Jesus was born in the King's family - <b>Judah</b>. One of his ancestor was King David.  He was the Messiah, but he refused to be the king, Israel people did not acknowledge him.

Messiah can't be found in the OT.  

<b>「弥赛亚」的字义</b>。英译文Messiah从希伯来文Masiah(有时写为mashiach)翻出来，这是一个普通的形容词，意思是「受膏的」。希腊文把它翻成christos，「受膏的」，由此引出「基督」(Christ)。「弥赛亚」与「基督」基本上意义相同，我们指耶稣为「基督」，新约作者亦把他等同于犹太的弥赛亚。

2) Matthew 1:18-25 Jesus was born to his mother Mary.  Most indescribable thing is: 
Mary was a virgin.  Science could not explain it.  Thing was done (事情就这样成了) . Jesus is a blameless (perfect) sacrifice/ lamb.  Jesus did not bear sin.

3) Jesus is the High Priest, in the order of Melchizedek. The name is written as two words, Malki-sedeq.  The KJV renders the name "Melchizedek" when translating from the Hebrew,  The name is composed from the two elements: melek(h), 'king', and sedeq, which means either 'righteousness' or the proper name Zedek, so that the name literally translates to 'king of righteousness'.

And Melchizedek king of Salem brought out bread and wine: and he was [is] the priest of the most high God. And he blessed him, and said, 'Blessed be Abram to the most high God, possessor of heaven and earth, And blessed be the most high God, which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand'. And he gave him tithe from all.   
— Genesis 14:18–20, King James Version

Do you understand God's plan?

We are sinners even after we professed our faith.  Example: 

Why God 'introduced' the sacrifice system?
