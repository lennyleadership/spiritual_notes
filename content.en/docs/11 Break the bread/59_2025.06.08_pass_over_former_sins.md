Romans 3:25-26 CUVS  
[25] 神 设 立 耶 稣 作 挽 回 祭 ， 是 凭 着 耶 稣 的 血 ， 藉 着 人 的 信 ， 要 显 明 神 的 义 ； 因 为 他 用 忍 耐 的 心 宽 容 人 先 时 所 犯 的 罪 ，   
[26] 好 在 今 时 显 明 他 的 义 ， 使 人 知 道 他 自 己 为 义 ， 也 称 信 耶 稣 的 人 为 义 。

Romans 3:25-26 NKJV  
[25] whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His <b>forbearance</b> God had passed over the <b>sins</b> that were previously committed,   
[26] to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

Romans 3:25-26 NET  
[25] God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat accessible through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because God in his <b>forbearance</b> had passed over the <b>sins</b> previously committed.   
[26] This was also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time, so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus' faithfulness.

God did not merely dismiss the charges against the guilty. Rather, God's righteous demands were met in Jesus' death.  God proved to be "just" in not overlooking sin, and he also freely chose to act as "justifier" for "the one who has faith in Jesus" [Reference: Gospel Transformation Study Bible ESV]

<b>passed over the sins</b>. This means neither indifference nor remission.  God's justice demands that every sin and sinner be punished. God would have been just, when Adam and Eve sinned, to destroy them, and with them, the entire human race.  But in His goodness and forbearance, He withheld His judgment for a certain period of time (cf. Ps. 78:38, 39; Acts 17:30,31; 2Pet. 3:9) [Reference: The MacArthur Study Bible]

<b>forbearance</b> (cf 2:4). This word, which means "to hold back," was sometimes used of a truce between warring parties.  Rather than destroying every person the moment he or she sins, God graciously holds back his judgement (cf 3:25). He saves sinners in a physical and temporal way from what they deserve (1Tim 4:10), to show them His saving character, that they might come to Him and receive salvation that is spiritual and eternal. [Reference: The MacArthur Study Bible]
