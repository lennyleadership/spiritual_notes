Romans 3:25-26 CUVS  
[25] 神 设 立 耶 稣 作 挽 回 祭 ， 是 凭 着 耶 稣 的 血 ， 藉 着 人 的 信 ， 要 显 明 神 的 义 ； 因 为 他 用 忍 耐 的 心 宽 容 人 先 时 所 犯 的 罪 ，   
[26] 好 在 今 时 显 明 他 的 义 ， 使 人 知 道 他 自 己 为 义 ， 也 称 信 耶 稣 的 人 为 义 。

Romans 3:25-26 NKJV  
[25] whom God set forth as a propitiation by His blood, through faith, to demonstrate His righteousness, because in His <b>forbearance</b> God had passed over the <b>sins</b> that were previously committed,   
[26] to demonstrate at the present time His righteousness, that He might be just and the justifier of the one who has faith in Jesus.

Romans 3:25-26 NET  
[25] God publicly displayed him at his death as the mercy seat accessible through faith. This was to demonstrate his righteousness, because God in his <b>forbearance</b> had passed over the <b>sins</b> previously committed.   
[26] This was also to demonstrate his righteousness in the present time, so that he would be just and the justifier of the one who lives because of Jesus' faithfulness.

God did not merely dismiss the charges against the guilty. Rather, God's righteous demands were met in Jesus' death.  God proved to be "just" in not overlooking sin, and he also freely chose to act as "justifier" for "the one who has faith in Jesus" [Reference: Gospel Transformation Study Bible ESV]

<b>passed over the sins</b>. This means neither indifference nor remission.  God's justice demands that every sin and sinner be punished. God would have been just, when Adam and Eve sinned, to destroy them, and with them, the entire human race.  But in His goodness and forbearance, He withheld His judgment for a certain period of time (cf. Ps. 78:38, 39; Acts 17:30,31; 2Pet. 3:9) [Reference: The MacArthur Study Bible]

<b>forbearance</b> (cf 2:4). This word, which means "to hold back," was sometimes used of a truce between warring parties.  Rather than destroying every person the moment he or she sins, God graciously holds back his judgement (cf 3:25). He saves sinners in a physical and temporal way from what they deserve (1Tim 4:10), to show them His saving character, that they might come to Him and receive salvation that is spiritual and eternal. [Reference: The MacArthur Study Bible]

One scholar, J. Barton Payne, has found as many as 574 verses in the Old Testament that somehow point to or describe or reference the coming Messiah.

旧约信徒的得救其实就是一种“赊账”。事实上，一位作者就曾写道：“如果基督没有死在十字架上，并为他们的罪付上赎价，那么他们就不得不被踢出天堂，打入地狱。  
So, how did the Old Testament believer experience full and final forgiveness during his lifetime? He did not! Not until the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, were the sins of the Old Testament believer permanently atoned for. That means the Old Testament believer was literally, saved on credit. In fact, one author wrote, “If Christ had not died on the cross to pay the penalty for their sin, they would have had to be brought out of heaven and sent to hell.”

罪的完全且最终的赎价就是弥赛亚。祂结束、成就、实现、确认并完成了整个代赎的制度。我们可以将其理解为：  
The full and final payment for sin was the Messiah. He summarized, finalized, fulfilled, confirmed, and completed the system of substitutionary atonement. It could be understood in this way:

    旧约时期的圣徒凭着对即将到来的赦免的信心上了天堂；
    新约时期的圣徒则凭着对已经到来的赦免的信心上了天堂。

• Old Testament saints went to heaven by faith in the forgiveness that was yet to come.  
• New Testament saints go to heaven by faith in the forgiveness that has come.

这么来看，神的救赎计划从未改变过。这个救赎计划就是：相信某个无罪之人或无罪之物为了另一个有罪之人的受死和牺牲。   
In that light, the plan of salvation has never changed. It is faith in the death of someone, or something sinless, for someone who is sinful.

旧约时期的信徒知道，那些在祭坛上濒死的动物就是他的替代者，这样他就可以避免受审，并继续活下来。同样的，新约时期的信徒也知道，在十字架上将死的神的羔羊，也是他们最终的替代者，因此所有相信的人都能避免审判，存活到永远。或者我这么说吧：  
The Old Testament believer knew the dying animal was his substitute, so that he could avoid judgment and live. The New Testament believer knows that the dying Lamb of God is the final substitute, so that all who believe can avoid judgment and live forever. Let me say it another way:

    对于旧约时期的信徒来说，无罪的动物预表着救赎；
    对于所有信徒来说，无罪的救主实现了救赎。

• For the Old Testament believer, the sinless animal foretold redemption.
• For all believers, the sinless Savior fulfilled redemption.

还要补充一句：
And let me say, as well:

    对于旧约时期的信徒来说，基督的十字架是预言；
    对于新约时期的信徒来说，基督的十字架是真实的历史。

• For the Old Testament believer, the cross of Christ was prophecy.
• For the New Testament believer, the cross of Christ is history.


正是在十字架上，父神将大卫、摩西、亚伯拉罕、以撒、雅各和其他所有旧约信徒的罪都加在了圣子的身上，同时也包括所有新约信徒的罪，因为他们都将自己的信心寄托在神的话语和神即将到来的救主的身上。  
It was on the cross that God the Father placed on God the Son, the sins of David, Moses, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and every other Old Testament believer, and every New Testament believer, who had placed their faith in God’s Word, and God’s coming Redeemer.


我再换一种说法：  
Let me say it another way:

    旧约时期的圣徒因着对基督未来的死的信心而得救；
    新约时期的圣徒则因着对基督过去的死的信心而得救。

• Old Testament saints were saved by faith in the future death of Christ.
• New Testament saints are saved by faith in the past death of Christ.

所以，每个去往天堂的人，都是因为耶稣才去的。历史上从来都没有、现在也没有别的路，可以让我们去往天堂。   
So, everyone who goes to heaven, gets there because of Jesus. There has never been and there is now, no other way to heaven.

不会的，神从未改变过规则，祂从未改变过救赎的计划。亚伯拉罕并不是因为神偏爱他而进入天堂的；摩西也不是因为他多年以来忍受和带领着那群顽固的以色列人而进入天堂的；大卫更不是因为他是一位才华横溢的福音歌手才进入天堂的。不是的，他们和如今的每一位信徒一样，都是因为有人替他们受死，有人为他们的罪受罚、流血牺牲，他们才得以进入天堂，得以重获新生。  
No. God has never changed the rules. He has never changed the plan of salvation. Abraham is not in heaven today, because God kind of liked him. Moses is not in heaven today, because he spent all those years putting up with ornery people. David is not in heaven today, because he was a talented gospel song writer. No. They, and every believer today, go to heaven because Someone died on behalf of their sins; because Someone took their punishment for them, shed His blood and died, that they could live.

事实上，我们跟大卫、摩西、雅各和亚伯拉罕都一样，我们都需要一位替罪者，为我们的罪受罚。 
The truth is, we are a lot more like David, and Moses, and Jacob, and Abraham than we thought.  We are all in need of a Substitute, who will be
punished in our place, for our sin.

对于旧约时期的信徒而言，他们所有的动物替代物都指向了那个最终的替代者，那就是道成肉身的神，神所预备的羔羊，神的儿子。对我们这些新约时期的信徒来说，我们有历史的优势，知道这位救世主的希腊名字是“耶稣”（Ιησούς），当我们把我们的信心寄托在祂最后和最终的献祭上时，我们过去、现在和将来的罪就都得到了赦免。   
For the Old Testament believer, all of their animal substitutes pointed toward the final Substitute, who was God incarnate, the Lamb of God, the Son of God. And, for those of us who are New Testament believers, having the benefit of history and knowing the Greek name of this Redeemer, Ιησευς, when we placed our faith in His final and ultimate sacrifice, then our sins, past, present, and future were forgiven.

这样的救恩具体是如此实现的：  
Here is how it works:  

    旧约时期的信徒通过预言的眼光期待基督的到来；
    新约时期的信徒通过历史的眼光回顾基督。

• The Old Testament believer looked forward to Christ through the eyes of prophecy.  
• The New Testament believer looks backward to Christ through the eyes of history.  

然而，对于这两者来说，他们所看到的情景都是一样的。那就是一位将要死去的替罪羔羊，为我们的罪付上了代价。   
The vision, however, remains the same for both. It is a vision of a dying Substitute, who took our penalty and paid the price for our sins.

Hebrews 10:1-7 CUVS  
[1] 律 法 既 是 将 来 美 事 的 影 儿 ， 不 是 本 物 的 真 像 ， 总 不 能 藉 着 每 年 常 献 一 样 的 祭 物 叫 那 近 前 来 的 人 得 以 完 全 。   
[2] 若 不 然 ， 献 祭 的 事 岂 不 早 已 止 住 了 麽 ？ 因 为 礼 拜 的 人 ， 良 心 既 被 洁 净 ， 就 不 再 觉 得 有 罪 了 。   
[3] 但 这 些 祭 物 是 叫 人 每 年 想 起 罪 来 ；   
[4] 因 为 公 牛 和 山 羊 的 血 ， 断 不 能 除 罪 。   
[5] 所 以 基 督 到 世 上 来 的 时 候 ， 就 说 ： 神 阿 ， 祭 物 和 礼 物 是 你 不 愿 意 的 ； 你 曾 给 我 预 备 了 身 体 。   
[6] 燔 祭 和 赎 罪 祭 是 你 不 喜 欢 的 。   
[7] 那 时 我 说 ： 神 阿 ， 我 来 了 ， 为 要 照 你 的 旨 意 行 ； 我 的 事 在 经 卷 上 已 经 记 载 了 。

Hebrews 10:1-7 NKJV  
[1] For the law, having a shadow of the good things to come, and not the very image of the things, can never with these same sacrifices, which they offer continually year by year, make those who approach perfect.   
[2] For then would they not have ceased to be offered? For the worshipers, once purified, would have had no more consciousness of sins.   
[3] But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins every year.   
[4] For it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins.   
[5] Therefore, when He came into the world, He said: "Sacrifice and offering You did not desire, But a body You have prepared for Me.   
[6] In burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin You had no pleasure.   
[7] Then I said, 'Behold, I have come- In the volume of the book it is written of Me- To do Your will, O God.'"

Hebrews 10:1-7 NET    
[1] For the law possesses a shadow of the good things to come but not the reality itself, and is therefore completely unable, by the same sacrifices offered continually, year after year, to perfect those who come to worship.   
[2] For otherwise would they not have ceased to be offered, since the worshipers would have been purified once for all and so have no further consciousness of sin?   
[3] But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year after year.   
[4] For it is impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.   
[5] So when he came into the world, he said, "Sacrifice and offering you did not desire, but a body you prepared for me.   
[6] "Whole burnt offerings and sin-offerings you took no delight in.   
[7] "Then I said, 'Here I am: I have come-it is written of me in the scroll of the book-to do your will, O God.'"
