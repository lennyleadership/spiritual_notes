哥林多前书 13:6 和合本    
6 不喜欢不义，只喜欢真理；   

1 Corinthians 13:6 WEB  
6 doesn’t rejoice in unrighteousness, but rejoices with the truth;  

Without the context, the first impression is that it is about holiness.  to live a life without blamelish until the day of the Lord [1 Thessalonians 5:23].

The context of 1 Corinthians 13:6 is about love.  

1 Peter 1:19 a lamb without blamelish.

罗马书 5:7-8 和合本  
7 为义人死，是少有的；为仁人死，或者有敢做的。  
8 惟有基督在我们还作罪人的时候为我们死，　神的爱就在此向我们显明了。  

Romans 5:7-8 NKJV   
7 For scarcely for a righteous man will one die; yet perhaps for a good man someone would even dare to die.  
8 But God demonstrates His own love toward us, in that while we were still sinners, Christ died for us.


Jesus gave a second chance to Apostle Peter.

1 Corinthians 13 verses define Jesus' life and God's character. Jesus is love.  

We don't know what is the new life, so Jesus came down, and lived it out for us.
