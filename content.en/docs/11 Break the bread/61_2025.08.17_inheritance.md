The concept of inheritance is comprehensive.

We are the inheritance of God.  God is the creator of everything, the universe, everything on the earth; and yet he chose us as his inheritance.  He cared us, protect us, complete salvation until the day of the Lord.


Yahweh is my [  ], shepherd, savior, rock, shelter, refuge, stronghold, and so on.  Yahweh is my <b>inheritance</b>.
1.1) The LORD is my shepherd, I shall not want [Psalms 23:1].  You are my LORD, I have nothing good besides you [Psalms 16:2].  The LORD is my chosen portion and my cup; you hold my lot [Psalms 16:5].  He set King David secure on the heights, he made his feet like the feet of a deer, he trained him for war, so that his arms can bend a bow of bronze [Psalms 18:33-34].  

The entire fullness of God's nature dwells bodily in Christ [Colossians 2:9].  

1.2) the meaning of "the Lord is my inheritance". The 


Paul considered everything to be nothing compared to knowing Jesus Christ. 

 

The Bible is the love story, that started at the beginning of the world, that continues now, and that will take forever.
