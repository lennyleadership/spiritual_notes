Mark 2:1-12 NKJV  
1 And again He entered Capernaum after some days, and it was heard that He was in the house.  
2 Immediately many gathered together, so that there was no longer room to receive them, not even near the door. And He preached the word to them.  
3 Then they came to Him, bringing a paralytic who was carried by four men.  
4 And when they could not come near Him because of the crowd, they uncovered the roof where He was. So when they had broken through, they let down the bed on which the paralytic was lying.  
5 When Jesus saw their faith, He said to the paralytic, “Son, your sins are forgiven you.”
6 And some of the scribes were sitting there and reasoning in their hearts,  
7 <b>“Why does this Man speak blasphemies like this? Who can forgive sins but God alone?”</b>  
8 But immediately, when Jesus perceived in His spirit that they reasoned thus within themselves, He said to them, “Why do you reason about these things in your hearts?  
9 <b>Which is easier, to say to the paralytic, ‘Your sins are forgiven you,’ or to say, ‘Arise, take up your bed and walk’?</b>  
10 But that you may know that the Son of Man has power on earth to forgive sins” — He said to the paralytic,  
11 “I say to you, arise, take up your bed, and go to your house.”   
12 Immediately he arose, took up the bed, and went out in the presence of them all, so that all were amazed and glorified God, saying, “We never saw anything like this!”

马可福音 2:1-12  
1 过了些日子，耶稣又进了迦百农。人听见他在房子里，  
2 就有许多人聚集，甚至连门前都没有空地。耶稣就对他们讲道。  
3 有人带着一个瘫子来见耶稣，是用四个人抬来的。  
4 因为人多，不得近前，就把耶稣所在的房子拆了房顶。既拆通了，就把瘫子连所躺卧的褥子都缒下来。  
5 耶稣见他们的信心，就对瘫子说：“小子，你的罪赦了！”  
6 有几个文士坐在那里，心里议论说：  
7 “这个人为什么这样说呢？他说僭妄的话了！除了神以外，谁能赦罪呢？”  
8 耶稣心中知道他们心里这样议论，就说：“你们心里为什么这样议论呢？  
9 或对瘫子说‘你的罪赦了’，或说‘起来，拿你的褥子行走’，哪一样容易呢？  
10 但要叫你们知道，人子在地上有赦罪的权柄。”就对瘫子说：  
11 “我吩咐你，起来，拿你的褥子回家去吧！”  
12 那人就起来，立刻拿着褥子，当众人面前出去了。以致众人都惊奇，归荣耀于神，说：“我们从来没有见过这样的事！”
