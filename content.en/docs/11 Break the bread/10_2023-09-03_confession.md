2 Peter reminding.  His salvation

What breaking of bread. 

I have sinned times without number,  
    and been guilty of pride and unbelief,  
  of failure to find thy mind in thy Word,  
  of neglect to seek thee in my daily life.  
  
We ran to Jesus for His new heart in regeneration, the cleansing of your sin, and the gift of the Holy Spirit who gave you power to live in holiness. 

On Sunday morning, we come to Jesus in the Lordâ€™s Supper for cleansing and power. 

asking him not only to cleanse you but also to feed you with his body and blood, so that you might have his holiness for further sanctification.

Prayer: Jesus is the high priest and the sacrificed lamb at the same time.
