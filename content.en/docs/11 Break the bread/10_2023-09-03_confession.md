Peter wrote two letters in order to stir up our pure minds by way of remembrance, so that we may be mindful of the words which were spoken before by the holy prophets, and of the commandment of the apostles of the Lord and Saviour.

reminder in 2 Peter. The breaking of bread is the time.

Psalm 18:31-32 ESV   
[32] For who is God, but the LORD? And who is a rock, except our God?-    
[32] the God who equipped me with strength and made my way blameless.


a portion of poem:  
I have sinned times without number,  
and been guilty of pride and unbelief,  
of failure to find thy mind in thy Word,  
of neglect to seek thee in my daily life.  

sin is subtle.

Psalm 19:12-13 ESV   
[12] Who can discern his errors? Declare me innocent from hidden faults.    
[13] Keep back your servant also from presumptuous sins; let them not have dominion over me! Then I shall be blameless, and innocent of great transgression.


When we come to the Lord's table congregationally, We examine ourselves, repent, ask Jesus to cleanse us, unite with Jesus Christ.



Prayer: Jesus is the high priest and the sacrificed lamb at the same time.

His salvation/sanctification, work of his body and blood
