Topic: What was going on in the garden of Gethsemane.

Analogy: prayer for safe drive to get Deep River

Jesus' disciples, Matthew, Mark, and Luke documented the moment when Jesus prayed in Gethsemane. [Matthew 26:36-45, Mark 14:32-42, and Luke 22:39-46]. Because Luke was a personal physician, he recorded details more than other two disciples.

Luke 22:42-44 ESV  
Jesus was sorrowful and troubled.  
[42][He prayed], "Father, if you are willing, remove this cup from me. Nevertheless, not my will, but yours, be done."   
[43] And there appeared to him an angel from heaven, strengthening him.   
[44] And being in agony he prayed more earnestly; and his sweat became like great drops of blood falling down to the ground.

We should not think this prayer expressed reluctance or a desire to turn back, or Jesus experienced the human limitation, or Jesus fought against human weakness.   

Instead Jesus knew why he came down to the world.

1. John chapter 3, verse 14 to 15  
[14] [Jesus told Nicodemus] ... as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up,   
[15] that whoever believes in him may have eternal life.

2. John chapter 12, verse 27  
[27] [Jesus spoke to the crowd] "Now is my soul troubled. And what shall I say? 'Father, save me from this hour'? But for this purpose I have come to this hour."

These verses proved to us that Jesus expected what must come at the end of his life.

So what was going on in Gethsemane? There is a hint. Jesus was sweating blood.  The medical term of such condition is called hematohidrosis. Some medical reports to this effect stated that it may occur in an individual who is under such intense pressure, such intense turmoil, such intense conflict, and as a result, he is close to a mortal stroke, he is close to dropping dead.  

What might happen was: Satan showed up one more time in the life of Jesus and tried to kill him.  

That is possible. We know God's plan is to rescue human being from Satan's kingdom.  God sent the God Son, Jesus, to the earth as a man to accomplish the salvation on the Cross. Therefore, Satan knows the cross is his defeat, and he attempted to destroy the plan. Prior to Calvary, the Devil would have stopped Jesus from going to the cross any way he could have. 

Here are four incidents.   

<li>King Herod assassins. He killed all the male children in Bethlehem and in all that region who were two years old or under.  However God had Joseph taken Jesus and Mary to Egypt beforehand.</li>
<li>Satan tempted Jesus in the wilderness.  Jesus defeated Satan with God's Words.</li>
<li>The religious leaders tried to thrown Jesus down a cliff (Luke 4:29).</li>
<li>The crowd picked up stones and threw to Him (John 8:59).</li>

In the last journey of his life, Jesus cried out to God and may pray to God, "don't let me die here, spare my life, let me live, let me go to that Cross."

And God listened His prayer, Satan's plan was failed, the work on the Cross was finished.

Brothers and sisters, Jesus fought against Satan in His life to the last minute for our salvation.

Do we take God's love for granted? Do we understand Jesus' death? If so, sin less, repent.  

<b>Prayer</b>:  
How precious we are in God's mind! so that God Father sacrificed Jesus, His begotten son.

What spiritual battles God fought against Satan in the days of Jesus flesh! so that  

We appreciate the cost you paid.

The Passover lamb.

<b>Background</b>:  

Our sin can be forgiven by God and we can live when we believe in Jesus.

Jesus became the high priest and the sacrifice.  You washed away our sin, we can come to God directly. -

Jesus was killed on the Day of Preparation of Passover (the following day was the Sabbath, in general Jesus was killed on Passover)
