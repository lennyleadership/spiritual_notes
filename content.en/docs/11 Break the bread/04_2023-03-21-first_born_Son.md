# Meditation

This morning, when we gather around the Lord’s table remembering Jesus’s death, I am going to read colossians chapter 1, from verse 9 to verse 23. I read the english standard version.

<div class = "quote">

Col 1:8-23 NAS95  
(8)  ... Epaphras ... informed us of your love in the Spirit.  
(9)  For this reason also, since the day we heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with the knowledge of His will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding,  
(10)  so that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, to please Him in all respects, bearing fruit in every good work and increasing in the knowledge of God;  
(11)  strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience; joyously  
(12)  giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints in Light.  
(13)  For He rescued us from the domain of darkness, and transferred us to the kingdom of His beloved Son,  
(14)  in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.  
(15)  He is the image of the invisible God, the firstborn of all creation.  
(16)  For by Him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth, visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities — all things have been created through Him and for Him.  
(17)  He is before all things, and in Him all things hold together.  
(18)  He is also head of the body, the church; and He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that He Himself will come to have first place in everything.  
(19)  For it was the Father's good pleasure for all the fullness to dwell in Him,  
(20)  and through Him to reconcile all things to Himself, having made peace through the blood of His cross; through Him, I say, whether things on earth or things in heaven.  
(21)  And although you were formerly alienated and hostile in mind, engaged in evil deeds,  
(22)  yet He has now reconciled you in His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach —  
(23)  if indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not moved away from the hope of the gospel that you have heard, which was proclaimed in all creation under heaven, ...  

</div>
Summary:  
<ol>
<li>&nbsp;All things, both in  the heavens and on earth, were created by Jesus, through Jesus and for Jesus.
</li>
<li>&nbsp;All the fullness dwells in Jesus.
</li>  
<li>&nbsp;We come before Him holy and blameless and beyond reproach.
</li>
</ol>

<br>

Let us pray:

Heavenly Father, when we partake the bread, we remember what Jesus has done on the cross.  By your will, Jesus Christ had offered himself as a single sacrifice for our sins for ever (Heb 10:12).  He became the first-born from the dead, and the first-born among many brothers and sisters.  Therefore, we become righteous and glorified.  We thank you for your rescue plan.






# Bible References
Six times in scripture the Lord Jesus is declared to be the first-born of God (Romans 8:29; Colossians 1:15, 18; Hebrews 1:6; 12:23; Revelation 1:5). These passages declare the preexistence, the sovereignty, and the redemption that Christ offers.

‪Colossians‬1:9-23 NLT  
9 So we have not stopped praying for you since we first heard about you. We ask God to give you complete knowledge of his will and to give you spiritual wisdom and understanding.   
10 Then the way you live will always honor and please the Lord, and your lives will produce every kind of good fruit. All the while, you will grow as you learn to know God better and better.  
11 We also pray that you will be strengthened with all his glorious power so you will have all the endurance and patience you need. May you be filled with joy,   
12 always thanking the Father. He has enabled you to share in the inheritance that belongs to his people, who live in the light.   
13 For he has rescued us from the kingdom of darkness and transferred us into the Kingdom of his dear Son,   
14 who purchased our freedom and forgave our sins.  
15 Christ is the visible image of the invisible God. He existed before anything was created and is supreme over all creation,
16 for through him God created everything in the heavenly realms and on earth. He made the things we can see and the things we can’t see — such as thrones, kingdoms, rulers, and authorities in the unseen world. Everything was created through him and for him.  
17 He existed before anything else, and he holds all creation together.  
18 Christ is also the head of the church, which is his body. He is the beginning, supreme over all who rise from the dead. So he is first in everything.  
19 For God in all his fullness was pleased to live in Christ,  
20 and through him God reconciled everything to himself.He made peace with everything in heaven and on earth by means of Christ’s blood on the cross.  
21 This includes you who were once far away from God. You were his enemies, separated from him by your evil thoughts and actions.   
22 Yet now he has reconciled you to himself through the death of Christ in his physical body. As a result, he has brought you into his own presence, and you are holy and blameless as you stand before him without a single fault.  
23 But you must continue to believe this truth and stand firmly in it. Don’t drift away from the assurance you received when you heard the Good News. The Good News has been preached all over the world, and I, Paul, have been appointed as God’s servant to proclaim it.

Romans 8:29-30 (NLT)   
29 For God knew his people in advance, and he chose them to become like his Son, so that his Son would be the firstborn among many brothers and sisters.  
30 And having chosen them, he called them to come to him. And having called them, he gave them right standing with himself. And having given them right standing, he gave them his glory.

‪罗马书‬8:29-30 (和合本)  
29 因为他预先所知道的人，就预先定下效法他儿子的模样，使他儿子在许多弟兄中作长子。 
30 预先所定下的人又召他们来；所召来的人又称他们为义；所称为义的人又叫他们得荣耀。
