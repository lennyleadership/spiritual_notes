This message was prepared for the communion service at Pinawa Alliance Church on 2023 Dec 31.

Reference: Galatians 4:4-5

I would like to read these two verses again this time.  There are two reasons. 
1) I echoed the theme of songs that Merv led - the goodness of God.  a) God is faithful in our life; b) God answered our prayers.
2) It reminded us what Pastor Cliff preached upon last Sunday.  Likewise, Jesus asked us to remember what he did on the Cross.
