Ezekiel was born into the priestly line (Ezekiel 1:3), but he served God as a prophet. In Ezekiel 40–48 Ezekiel sees a detailed vision of a grand and glorious temple. This lengthy vision has been the subject of much speculation and various interpretations through the years.

Ezekiel began his prophetic ministry before Jerusalem and the temple were destroyed by Babylon in 586 BC. Prior to the destruction, many false prophets assured the people that God was with them and that nothing would happen to them (Ezekiel 13:8–16). True prophets like Jeremiah and Ezekiel warned the people that God’s judgment was coming (Ezekiel 2:3–8). In Ezekiel 8–11, the prophet sees the glory of God leaving the temple.

Ezekiel was taken into exile to Babylon, probably in the second deportation of Jews, in 597 BC. In exile, he encouraged Israel that judgment would not last forever, but that God would restore Israel and once again live among them. In Ezekiel 37 he relates the vision of “The Valley of Dry Bones,” in which he describes the reunification and reanimation of a dead Israel. In chapters 38–39, Ezekiel predicts a battle with Gog and Magog, in which Israel’s enemies are defeated. Then, in chapters 40–48, in the twenty-fifth year of Israel’s captivity, Ezekiel describes an enormous new temple (chapters 40–42). The glory of God returns (chapter 43), sacrifices are resumed (chapters 44–46), and the land is restored to the people of Israel (47–48). The hearts of the people will have been changed (Ezekiel 36:26–27), and even Gentiles have a place in the restored kingdom (Ezekiel 47:22). The land will be ruled by a Davidic Prince (Ezekiel 44:3; see also 37:24–25; 34:23–24).

In his vision of the temple, Ezekiel is taken to Israel where he sees a mountain and a city. He is met by “a man whose appearance was like bronze; he was standing in the gateway with a linen cord and a measuring rod in his hand” (Ezekiel 40:3). The man tells Ezekiel to pay careful attention to everything he sees and hears and to relate all the details to God’s people (verse 4). The measuring of the layout of the temple complex fills the next three chapters of Ezekiel.

The question is when and how will the vision of Ezekiel’s temple be fulfilled? Should we look for a literal fulfillment? Or is this vision symbolic of the future perfection of God’s presence among His people? Has it already been fulfilled? Or is the fulfillment still future? If Ezekiel’s temple is future, will it be fulfilled in the church age, the millennium, or in the eternal state? The answers to these questions will be determined, most likely, by the interpreter’s presuppositions regarding the literal or symbolic nature of prophecy and fulfillment.

Arguing for a literal fulfillment of the prophecy of Ezekiel’s temple are the numerous details of Ezekiel’s vision and the specific dimensions of the temple. If the vision is to be literally fulfilled, then the fulfillment must be future, for nothing like what is described in Ezekiel 40–48 has taken place up to this point. The dimensions of Ezekiel’s temple are far larger than the temple in Jesus’ day, and that temple was a grand structure.

Most who expect a literal fulfillment of Ezekiel’s temple expect it to be erected in the millennial kingdom, a 1,000-year reign of Christ upon the earth. During the millennium, glorified saints from the present age will live in contact with natural human beings who will still need to make a decision for Christ in order to be saved—and many will choose not to trust Him. The sacrificial system described in Ezekiel cannot be for the forgiveness of sins, for Christ has accomplished that once and for all (Hebrews 10:1–4, 11–14). In this interpretive approach, <b>the sacrifices are seen as memorials of Christ’s death or as rites for the ceremonial cleansing of the temple, but not as a means to forgive sins</b>.

In the figurative view of Ezekiel’s temple, the prophet’s vision simply reiterates that God will once again dwell with His people in a perfect relationship. This relationship is described in the language that the people of the day (and especially for Ezekiel as a priest) would have understood—a Jewish temple of magnificent proportions, with regular, perfect sacrifices, with the Messiah presiding, and with the glory of God visibly evident. In later visions to other prophets, God revealed more about how He would accomplish this with the Messiah Himself replacing the temple, the sacrifices, and the land. The presence of God through the indwelling of the Holy Spirit would be more immediately evident than ever before. The fulfillment of Ezekiel’s temple could thus be realized in the church age to some degree and, in the age to come, to perfection.

Regardless of which approach is taken, the vision of Ezekiel’s temple says that God has not forsaken His people and that His relationship with them will be restored and elevated to a new, never-before-conceived glory and intimacy. Present circumstances should never cause one to doubt the promises of God.

以西结出生在祭司的行列(以西结书1:3)，但他作为先知侍奉神。在以西结书40-48章中，以西结详细地看到了一座宏伟壮丽的圣殿的异象。多年来，这一漫长的异象一直是许多猜测和各种解释的主题。

以西结在耶路撒冷和圣殿于公元前586年被巴比伦摧毁之前就开始了他的先知传道。在毁灭之前，许多假先知向人们保证神与他们同在，不会发生什么事(以西结书13:8-16)。真正的先知像耶利米和以西结警告人们神的审判即将来临(以西结书2:3-8)。在以西结书8-11章中，先知看到了神的荣耀离开圣殿。

在流放期间，他鼓励以色列人说，审判不会永远持续下去，而且神会使以色列复兴，并再次生活在他们中间。在以西结书37章中，他叙述了“枯骨复苏”的异象，在那里他描述了死去的以色列全家的统一和复兴。在38-39章中，以西结预言了一场与歌革和玛各的战争，以色列的敌人在这场战争中被击败。然后，在40-48章，以色列人被掳的第25年，以西结描述了一座巨大的新圣殿(40-42章)。神的荣耀回归(第43章)，献祭得到恢复(第44-46章)，而且土地归还给以色列人(47-48章)。人们的心将会改变(以西结书36:26-27)，甚至外邦人在恢复的王国中也有一席之地(以西结书47:22)。这地将由大卫的后裔统治(以西结书44:3;又见37:24-25;34:23-24)。

在他对圣殿的异象中，以西结被带到以色列，在那里他看到一座山和一座城。他所遇见的这个人，“颜色如铜，手拿麻绳和量度的竿站在门口”(以西结书40:3)。这个人告诉以西结要仔细留意他所看到和听到的一切，并将所有的细节都与神的子民联系起来(第4节)。以西结书接下来三章都是关于测量圣殿的布局。

问题是，以西结圣殿的异象何时、如何实现？我们应该寻求字面上的实现吗？或者这异象是神与他的子民同在的未来完全的象征吗？已经实现了吗？还是未来才实现呢？如果以西结圣殿是未来，它会在教会时代，千年王国，还是在永恒的状态中实现吗？这些问题的答案很可能取决于解释者对预言和实现的字面或象征性质的预设。

以西结圣殿预言的字面上的实现是通过以西结所见异象的许多细节和圣殿的具体尺寸来论证的。如果异象是字面上的实现，那么实现一定是未来的，因为迄今为止，没有任何事像以西结书40-48中所描述的那样发生过。以西结圣殿比耶稣时代的圣殿大得多，是一座宏伟的建筑。

大多数期望以西结圣殿能真正实现的人，都期望它能建立在千年国度里，基督在地上统治一千年。在千禧年，来自今世的荣耀的圣徒将与自然的人类生活在一起，这些人为了得拯救，仍然需要作出决定选择基督——许多人将选择不相信他。以西结书中所描述的献祭体系不可能是为了罪得赦免，因为基督已经一次性地完成了这一点(希伯来书10:1-4,11-14)。在这种解释方法中，<b>献祭被看作是对基督死亡的纪念，或作为洁净圣殿的仪式，而不是赦免罪的手段</b>。

在以西结圣殿的比喻中，先知的异象只是重申神将再次以完全的关系与他的子民同住。这种关系用当时（特别是以西结作为祭司时候）的人所理解的语言来描述——一座规模宏大的犹太圣殿，有固定的、完美的献祭，有弥赛亚掌管，神的荣耀明显可见。在后来给其他先知的异象中，神更多地揭示了他将如何用弥赛亚自己代替圣殿、献祭和土地来完成这一使命。借着圣灵的内住，神的同在比以往任何时候都更加明显。因此，以西结圣殿在某种程度上可以在教会时代实现，在未来的时代实现完全。

无论采取哪种方式，以西结圣殿的异象都表明，神没有离弃他的子民，他与他们的关系将会恢复，并提升为前所未有的新的荣耀和亲密。目前的情况从来不应使人怀疑神的应许。
