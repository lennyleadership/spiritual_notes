1) Did Abram choose to believe in God? No.  

2) How God held his promise when Abram showed little faith?  

3) What did Abram and Lot learn when God protected them?  
Abram and Lot showed their faith in test when picking land.  They showed different look.

a) Although Lot was a righteous man (2 Pt 2:6-7), Lot trusted materialism now, build his trust in prosperity. Genesis 14:12-16ï¼Œ19:1-13   
b) Deuteronomy 23:3, Ammonite or Moabite shall not enter into the congregation of the Lord. 

4) A pair of comparison in the NT.  The story of Paul vs. Demas in Philemon 1:24, Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:10.

Demas was put in the prison with Paul in the first missionary trip.  Same persecution, different reaction.

5) There are two types of believers, one strengthened their faith after turmoil, one weakened their faith like Lot and Demas.

5) How shall we response after God answered your prayers?

6) How shall we live with believers, like Lot and Demas?

7) How shall we live with spouse, like Lot and Demas?
