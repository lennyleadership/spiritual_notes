# Session #1 The death of Anaias and Sapphira in Acts 5:1-11

Linda L. shared the fruit of thoughts on the death of Anaias and Sappharia.  She realized that it is a serious issue to deceive God, and because of that, this couple were worse than those who initiated wars.  

Kevin Y.: In the early formation of church, God showed that it is important for church to be pure from beginning, and believers shall live holy life and fear the Lord.  

(Psalms 51:1-4 ESV David repentance after he had committed adultery with Bathsheba) Pay attention that the verses did not say the King David sinned against Bathsheba and her to-be-died husband Uriah, but say he sinned against God.  

The Russia president, Putin, started the war.  He sinned against God.  God created Putin to reflect God's image, and yet he polluted God's image.

Anaias and Sappharia thought God did not know what they did.

Romans 3:23 ESV  is the definition of sin.  Human being missed the God's standard, missed the bull's eye.  

We all sin against God.  

WE shall confess our sin before God, say sorry to God, then say sorry to others.

1 Peter 3:7 The relationship with spouse goes broken, the prayers will be hindered.  It applies to other relationship.
