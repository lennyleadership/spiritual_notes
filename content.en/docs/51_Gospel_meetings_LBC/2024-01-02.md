1) Did Abram choose to believe in God? No.  

2) How God held his promise when Abram showed little faith?  

3) What did Abram and Lot learn when God protected them?  
Abram and Lot showed their faith in test when picking land.  They showed different look.

4) A pair of comparison in the NT.  The story of Paul vs. Demas in Philemon 1:24, Colossians 4:14, 2 Timothy 4:10.

Demas was put in the prison with Paul in the first missionary trip.  Same persecution, different reaction.
