<b><font class = "font_upper">Question</font></b>: Why do Christians still sin?  

Non-believers have no power over sin and sins.  

A Christian breaks God's heart if they sin.  

Romans 7:4-25

<div class = "quote">
A Christian:

1) is delivered from the Penalty of Sin which is the second death. Romans 6:23

2) is being delivered from the Power of Sin. Romans 6.  

3) will be delivered totally from the Presence of Sin at the end of the day. For in Heaven there is no Sin. Rev 21: 1-7
