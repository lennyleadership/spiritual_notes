Text Sermons : Classic Christian Writings : The Glorious Filling Of The Holy Spirit By Andrew Murray


"They were all filled with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:4).  

Whenever we speak of being filled with the Holy Spirit, and desire to know what it precisely is, our 
thoughts always turn back to the day of Pentecost. There we see as in a mirror how glorious the 
blessing is that is brought from heaven by the Holy Spirit and with which He can fill the hearts of men.

There is one fact which makes the great event of the day of Pentecost doubly instructive this 
namely, that we have learned to know very intimately the men who were then filled with the Spirit, by 
their fellowship for three years with the Lord Jesus. Their infirmities and defects, their sins and 
perversities, all stand open to our view. But the blessing of Pentecost wrought a complete
 transformation. They became entirely new men, so that one might say of them with truth: "Old things
 are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor. 5:17). Close study of them and their
 example helps us in more than one way. It shows us to what weak and sinful men the Spirit will
come. It teaches us how they were prepared for the blessing.
