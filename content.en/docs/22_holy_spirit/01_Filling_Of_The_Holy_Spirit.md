Text Sermons : Classic Christian Writings : The Glorious Filling Of The Holy Spirit By Andrew Murray


"They were all filled with the Holy Spirit" (Acts 2:4).  

Whenever we speak of being filled with the Holy Spirit, and desire to know what it precisely is, our 
thoughts always turn back to the day of Pentecost. There we see as in a mirror how glorious the 
blessing is that is brought from heaven by the Holy Spirit and with which He can fill the hearts of men.

There is one fact which makes the great event of the day of Pentecost doubly instructive this 
namely, that we have learned to know very intimately the men who were then filled with the Spirit, by 
their fellowship for three years with the Lord Jesus. Their infirmities and defects, their sins and 
perversities, all stand open to our view. But <u class = "red">the blessing of Pentecost wrought a complete
 transformation</u>. They became entirely new men, so that one might say of them with truth: "Old things
 are passed away; behold, all things are become new" (2 Cor. 5:17). Close study of them and their
 example helps us in more than one way. It shows us to what weak and sinful men the Spirit will
come. It teaches us how they were prepared for the blessing.

It teaches us also  and this is the principal thing  how mighty and complete the revolution is that is
brought to pass when the Holy Spirit is received in His fullness. It lets us see how glorious the grace 
that awaits us is if we press on to the full blessing of Pentecost.

The ever-abiding presence and indwelling of the Lord Jesus.

In this we have the first and principal blessing of the Pentecostal life. In the course of our Lords 
dealings with His disciples on earth He spared no pains to teach and train them, to renew and sanctify 
them. In most respects, however, they remained just what they were. The reason was that up to this
 point He was nothing more than an external Christ who stood outside of them and from without
 sought to work upon them by His word and His personal influence. With the advent of Pentecost this
 condition was entirely changed.


In the Holy Spirit He came down as the inward, indwelling Christ, to become in the very innermost 
recesses of their being the life of their life. This is what He Himself had promised in the words: "I will
 not leave you comfortless: I will come to you. At that day ye shall know that I am in My Father, and
 ye in Me, and I in you" (John 14:18,20).

This was the source of all the other blessings that came with Pentecost. Jesus Christ, the crucified, the
glorified, the Lord from heaven, came in spiritual power, by the Spirit, to impart to them that ever-
abiding presence of their Lord that had been promised to them. And that was in a way that was most
 intimate, all-powerful, and wholly divine: by the indwelling which makes Him in truth their life. Him
 whom they had had in the flesh, living with them on earth, they now received by the Spirit in His
 heavenly glory within them! Instead of an outward Jesus near them, they now obtained the inward
 Jesus within them.

The Spirit of Jesus came into them as the life and the power of sanctification.

This springs from the first and principal blessing. Here I shall allude at the outset to only one feature 
in this change. We know how often the Lord had to rebuke them for their pride and exhort them to
 humility. It was all of no avail. Even on the last night of His earthly life, at the table of the Holy
 Supper, there was a strife amongst them as to which of them should be the greatest (Luke 22:24).

The outward teaching of the outward Christ, whatever other influences it may have exercised, was not
 sufficient to redeem them from the power of indwelling sin. This could be achieved only by the
 indwelling Christ. Only when Jesus descended into them by the Holy Spirit did they undergo a
 complete change. They received Him in His heavenly humility and subjection to the Father, and in His
 self-sacrifice for others, as their life. Henceforth all was changed. From that moment onwards they
 were animated by the spirit of the meek and lowly Jesus.

This in very truth is still the only way to a real sanctification, to a life that actually overcomes sin.
 Many preachers and many Christians keep their minds occupied only with the external Christ on the
 cross or in heaven, and wait for the blessing of His teaching and His working without understanding
 that the blessing of Pentecost brings Him into us, to work Himself all in us. Because of this, they
 make little progress in sanctification. Christ Himself is of God made unto us sanctification: and that in
 no other way than by our living and being moved and existing in Him, because He lives and abides in
 our heart and works all there (1 Cor. 1:30).

An overflowing of the heart with the love of God.

This also is a part of the blessing of Pentecost. Next to pride, lack of love  or as we may put it in one 
word, lovelessness  was the sin for which the Lord had so often to rebuke His disciples. These two sins
 have in truth one and the same root: the self-seeking I, the desire for self-pleasing. The new
 commandment that He gave them, the token whereby all men should know that they were His
 disciples, was love to one another (John 13:35).

How gloriously was it manifested on the day of Pentecost that the Spirit of the Lord shed abroad His
 love in the hearts of His own. The multitude of them that believed were as one heart, one soul. All
 things they possessed were held in common. No one said that anything of that which he had was his
 own. The kingdom of heaven with its life of love had come down to them. The spirit, the disposition,
 the wonderful love of Jesus, filled them, because He Himself had come into them.

How closely the mighty working of the Spirit and the indwelling of the Lord Jesus are bound up with a
 life in love appears from the prayer of Paul in behalf of the Ephesians. He asks that they might be
 strengthened with power by the Spirit, in order that Christ might dwell in their hearts. Then he
 forthwith makes this addition: "that ye, being rooted and grounded in love, may be strong to
 apprehend the love of Christ which passeth knowledge" (Eph. 3:17-19).

The filling with the Spirit and the indwelling of Christ bring of themselves a life that has its root, its
 joy, its power, its evidence in love, because the indwelling Christ Himself is Love. O how would the
 love of God fill the Church and convince the world that she has received a heavenly element into her
 life, if the filling with the Spirit and the indwelling of Christ in the heart were recognized as the
 blessing which the Father has promised us!

The coming of the Spirit changed weakness and fear into courage and power.

We all know how, from fear rising in his heart at the word of a woman, Peter denied his Lord, and how
 that same night all the disciples fled and forsook Him. Their hearts were really attached to Him, and
 they were sincerely willing to do what they had promised and go to die with Him. But when it came to
 the crisis, they had neither courage nor power. They had to say: "To will is present with me, but to
 perform that which is good I find not" (Rom. 7:18).

After the blessing of the Spirit of Pentecost, there was no more question of merely willing apart from
 performing. By Christ dwelling in us God works both the willing and the doing (Phil. 2:13). With what
 confidence of spirit did Peter on the day of Pentecost dare to preach the Crucified One to thousands of
 hostile Jews. With what boldness was he able in opposition to the leaders of the people, to say, "We
 ought to obey God rather than men" (Acts 5:29).

With what courage and joy were Stephen and Paul and so many others enabled to encounter
 threatening and suffering and death. They did this even triumphantly. It was because the Spirit of
 Christ, the Victor  yes, the Christ Himself, who had been glorified  dwelt within them. It is the joy of
 the blessing of Pentecost that gives courage and power to speak for Jesus, because by it the whole
 heart is filled with Him.

The blessing of Pentecost makes the whole Word of God new.

How distinctly do we see this fact in the case of the disciples. As with all the Jews of that age, their
 ideas of the Messiah and the kingdom of God were utterly external and carnal. All the instruction of
 the Lord Jesus throughout three long years could not detach their minds from them. They were
 utterly unable to comprehend the doctrine of a suffering and dying Messiah or the hope of His
 invisible spiritual dominion. Even after His resurrection He had to rebuke them for their unbelieving
 spirit and their backwardness in understanding the Scriptures.

With the coming of the day of Pentecost an entire change took place. The whole of their ancient
 Scriptures opened up before them. The light of the Holy Spirit in them illumined the Word. In the
 preaching of Peter and Stephen, in the addresses of Paul and James, we see how a divine light had
 shone upon the Word of the Old Testament. They saw everything through the Spirit of this Jesus who
 had made His abode with them.

So will it be also with ourselves. It is as necessary as it is helpful that we should study the Scriptures
 and meditate upon them, and keep the Word of God alike in head and heart and daily walk. Let us,
 however, constantly remember that it is only when we are filled with the Spirit that we can rightly and
 fully experience the spiritual power and truth of the Word. He is "the Spirit of truth." He alone guides
 into all truth when He dwells in us (John 14:17; 16:13).

It is the blessing of Pentecost that gives power to bless others.

The divine power of the exalted Jesus to grant repentance and the forgiveness of sins is exercised by
 Him through His servants whom He sends forth to proclaim these blessings. The minister of the
 Gospel who desires to preach repentance and forgiveness through Jesus with success in winning
 souls, must do the work in the power of the Spirit of this Jesus.

The chief reason why so much preaching of conversion and pardon is fruitless lies in the fact that
 these elements of truth are presented only as a doctrine. Preachers endeavor to secure a way to the
 hearts of their audience in the power of merely human earnestness and reasoning and eloquence. But
 little blessing is won by these means.

It is the man that makes it his chief desire to be filled with the Spirit of God, and then by faith in the
 indwelling of Christ comes to be assured that the glorified Lord will speak and work in him, who will
 obtain blessing. It is true, indeed, that this blessing will not always be given in the very same
 measure or in the very same manner, but it will always certainly come, just because the preacher
 permits the Lord to work in and through him. Alike in preaching and in the daily life of a servant of
 Christ, the full blessing of Pentecost is the sure way of becoming a blessing to others. "He that
 believeth in Me," said Jesus, "out of his belly shall flow rivers of living water" (John 7:38). This He
 said of the Holy Spirit. A heart filled with the Spirit will overflow with the Spirit.

It is the blessing of Pentecost that will make the Church of Christ what God would have her be.

We have spoken of what the Spirit will do in individual believers. We have also to think of what the 
blessing will be when the Church as a whole shall apprehend her calling to be filled with the Spirit, and
 then to exhibit the life and the power  yes, and the very presence  of her Lord to the world. We must
 not only seek and receive this blessing, every one for himself, but we must also remember that the
 full manifestation of what the blessing itself is, cannot be given until the whole body of Christ be filled
 with it.

"If one member suffers, all the members suffer with it" (1 Cor. 12:26). If many members of the
 Church of Christ are content to remain without this blessing, the whole Church will suffer. Even in
 individual disciples the blessing cannot come to its full manifestation. Hence it is of the utmost
 importance that we should not only think of what the being "filled with the Spirit" means for
 ourselves, but also consider what it will do for the Church, especially in our own neighborhood, and
 by her for all the world.

To this end, let us simply recall the morning of the day of Pentecost. At that juncture the Christian
 Church in Jerusalem consisted only of one hundred and twenty disciples, most of them unlearned
 fishermen, publicans and humble women, an insignificant and despised gathering (Acts 1:15). Yet it
 was just by these believers that the kingdom of God had to be proclaimed and extended, and they did
 it. By them, and those who were added to them, the power of Jewish prejudice and of pagan
 hardness of heart was overcome, and the Church of Christ won glorious triumphs.

This grand result was achieved simply and only because the first Christian Church was filled with the
 Spirit. The members of it gave themselves wholly to their Lord. They allowed themselves to be filled
 and consecrated, governed and used only by Him. They yielded themselves to Him as instruments of
 His power. He dwelt in them and wrought in them all His wondrous deeds.

It is to this same experience that the Church of Christ in our age must be brought back. This is the
 only thing that will help her in the conflict with mere civilization or paganism, with sin or the world.
 She must be filled with the Spirit.

One Thing Needful

Beloved fellow Christians, this summons comes to you. "One thing is needful" (Luke 10:42). Alike for
 yourselves and the whole Church of the Lord, this is the one thing that is needful: we have to be filled
 with the Spirit. Please do not imagine that you must comprehend or understand it all before you seek
 and find it. For those who wait upon Him God will do even that which has not yet entered into their
 heart to conceive.

If you would taste the happiness, if you would know by personal experience the unutterable
 blessedness of having Jesus in the heart, of having in you His Spirit of holiness and humility, of love
 and self-sacrifice, of courage and power, as naturally and continuously as you have your own spirit; if
 you would have the Word of God in you as light and power, and be enabled to carry it about as a
 blessing for others; if you would see the Church of Christ stand forth arrayed in her first splendor 
 then separate yourselves from everything that is evil. Cast evil utterly out of your heart, and fix your
 desire on this one thing: to be filled with the Spirit of God. Reckon upon receiving this as your rightful
 heritage. Appropriate it and hold it fast by faith. It shall certainly be given you.

From The Full Blessing Of Pentecost by Andrew Murray.
