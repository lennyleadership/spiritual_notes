羅 馬 書 9:14-15 CUVS
[14] 这 样 ， 我 们 可 说 甚 麽 呢 ？ 难 道 神 有 甚 麽 不 公 平 麽 ？ 断 乎 没 有 ！   
[15] 因 他 对 摩 西 说 ： 我 要 怜 悯 谁 就 怜 悯 谁 ， 要 恩 待 谁 就 恩 待 谁 。

Romans 9:14-15 CSB
[14] What should we say then? Is there injustice with God? Absolutely not!   
[15] For he tells Moses, I will show mercy to whom I will show mercy, and I will have compassion on whom I will have compassion.

The Father of justice, God is the ultimate judge over the lives and actions of men. There seems to be so much injustice in the world (men lie, cheat, steal, and kill all the time with no seeming repercussions), but true justice is not meted out in this earthly realm, but in the true realm (the eternal heavenly realm). In the end, each man will receive his just deserts at the hands of an immutable God who cannot be persuaded or bribed. Christ will look at each man's heart and if it is the least bit corrupted by sin, that man, not being pure, will receive the justice of hell. The believer too would fail this test, if he were not already made clean by his baptism into Christ's death. Thus he is rightly judged clean by Christ and enters into eternal Sabbath. In God's justice, we can find a comfort for all the wrongs perpetrated against us and against mankind. We know that our cruel boss who cheated us for so many years will receive what he deserves. We know that the politician who did wrong to gain personal power will receive justice. We know that killers like Hitler, Stalin, and Pol Pot will receive justice. And we know that we will receive justice as well. That can be scary for one who truly knows his heart's deceitfulness and is not a believer, but the Christian rests in his sweet faith in Christ, knowing that he is judged in Christ (cf. Romans 2:16) and his safety is thus secured.
