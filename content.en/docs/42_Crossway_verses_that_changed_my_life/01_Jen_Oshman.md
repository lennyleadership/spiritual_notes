1 Corinthians 6:19-20

歌 林 多 前 書 6:19-20 CUVS    
[19] 岂 不 知 你 们 的 身 子 就 是 圣 灵 的 殿 麽 ？ 这 圣 灵 是 从 神 而 来 ， 住 在 你 们 里 头 的 ； 并 且 你 们 不 是 自 己 的 人 ；   
[20] 因 为 你 们 是 重 价 买 来 的 。 所 以 ， 要 在 你 们 的 身 子 上 荣 耀 神 。

1 Corinthians 6:19-20 CSB  
[19] Don't you know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God? You are not your own,   
[20] for you were bought at a price. So glorify God with your body.


不要凭自己的能力而活，要凭圣灵而活。  
Don't live for yourself, but live by Him, for Him, through Him.  

Don't live in your own strength.

Hi, I'm Jen Oschman, and the verse that changed my life is from 1 Corinthians 6, 19, and 20. 

>You are not your own, for you were bought with a price, so glorify God in your body.  

I was a freshman in college when that verse really captured my soul.  I was living under the weight of feeling like I had to perform in order to be approved of by my God, by my friends, by my parents, by my community. I felt like I needed to have the perfect grades, the perfect sports participation, the perfect social life, and do everything just so that I might be approved of by others.     But it turns out college is not high school, and it was hard, and I did not do well. I was failing in every sense of the word, and the Lord used that failure to really draw me to himself. It was a gift of grace to experience burnout as a college freshman.     So there on my dorm room floor, as I cried out to God, Lord, help me. This is terrible. I need your help. I need your rescue. I need you to make it better.  

The Lord showed me this verse, and he said, Jen, you are not your own.  That's clearly in the word. You are not your own. I bought you with my blood. I bought you. I paid a high price. In fact, the breath in your lungs belongs to me. Your life and breath and all that you have belongs to me.     

And as the Spirit just communicated that to me, it did two things.
(1) One, it served as a correction. I had been living for myself. I had felt like it was on me to perform. It was on me to excel, to succeed, to reach my goals.  
So <b>I was really living for my own glory, for my own fame, or my own wealth, for my own name</b>. And so the Lord corrected me in that and said, you do not belong to yourself. You actually belong to me. 
(2) But not only was it a correction it was actually a tremendous relief.  For the first time I realized I am not my own. I actually have a good God who made me and died to save me; a God who stopped at nothing to make me his own. 
And no longer did I feel like it's all on me. No longer did I feel that pressure to perform and to seek approval and to be all that I could be <b>in my own strength and own power for my own glory </b> that all fell away.  
And for the first time I feel like I saw God clearly and received <b>just his power</b> the indwelling spirit within me to live by him, for him, through him to him as Colossians says. 

So this verse changed me in that it corrected me it corrected my life trajectory but it also brought some tremendous peace and relief.  
And now I am so glad to remember that I am not my own but I belong to Jesus.
