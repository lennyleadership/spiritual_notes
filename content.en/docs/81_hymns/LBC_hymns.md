A purple robe, a crown of thorn
<br>A reed in his right hand
<br>Before the soldiers' spite and scorn

<br>He bears between the Roman guard
<br>The weight of all our woe
<br>A stumbling figure bowed and scarred

<br>Fast to the cross spreading span
<br>High in the sunlit air
<br>All the unnumbered sins of man

<br>
<br>He hangs, by whom the world was made
<br>Beneath the darkened sky
<br>The everlasting ransom paid
<br>I see my Saviour die
<br>
<br>He shares on high His Father's throne
<br>Who once in mercy came
<br>For all His love to sinners shown

紫色的袍荊棘冠冕，
<br>蘆葦杖在右手；
<br>兵丁唾面，嘲笑譏諷，
<br>我見救主站立；
<br>
<br>祂在羅馬守衛面前，
<br>承受我們罪責，
<br>鞭打刑罰，令人掩面，
<br>我見救主前行。
<br>
<br>急步奔向巨大十架，
<br>高懸在烈日下，
<br>人類數不盡的罪惡，
<br>我見我救主擔當；
<br>
<br>懸在十架是創造主，
<br>天色漸漸昏暗；
<br>永遠的贖價已償還，
<br>我見救主逝去；

<br>祂曾懷憐憫到世上，
<br>現在高天掌權，
<br>因為祂對罪人的愛，
<br>我歌頌祂的名。

It will never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
While the tempest rages on
When temptation claims the battle
And it seems the night has won
Deeper still then goes the anchor
Though I justly stand accused
I will hold fast to the anchor
It shall never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
Through the floods of unbelief
Hopeless somehow, O my soul, now
Lift your eyes to Calvary
This my ballast of assurance
See his love forever proved
I will hold fast to the anchor
It will never be removed

Christ the sure and steady anchor
As we face the wave of death
When these trials give way to glory
As we draw our final breath
We will cross that great horizon
Clouds behind and life secure
And the calm will be the better
For the storms that we endure

Christ the sure of our salvation
Ever faithful, ever true
We will hold fast to the anchor
It shall never be removed

Robed in frail humanity
In our longing, in our darkness
Now the light of life has come
Look to Christ, who condescended
Took on flesh to ransom us

Come behold the wondrous mystery
He the perfect Son of Man
In His living, in His suffering
Never trace nor stain of sin
See the true and better Adam
Come to save the hell-bound man
Christ the great and sure fulfillment
Of the law; in Him we stand

Come behold the wondrous mystery
Christ the Lord upon the tree
In the stead of ruined sinners
Hangs the Lamb in victory
See the price of our redemption
See the Father’s plan unfold
Bringing many sons to glory
Grace unmeasured, love untold

Come behold the wondrous mystery
Slain by death the God of life
But no grave could ever restrain Him
Praise the Lord; He is alive!
What a foretaste of deliverance
How unwavering our hope
Christ in power resurrected
As we will be when He comes

Rich wounds, yet visible above
In beauty glorified

But downward bends His wondering eye
At mysteries so bright

Crown Him the Lord of life
Who triumphed o’er the grave
Who rose victorious in the strife
For those He came to save
His glories now we sing
Who died, and rose on high
Who died eternal life to bring
And lives that death may die

Crown Him the Lord of heaven

One with the Spirit through Him given
From yonder glorious throne
To Thee be endless praise
For Thou for us hast died
Be Thou, O Lord, through endless days

Down from His glory, ever living story
My God and Savior came, and Jesus was His name
Born in a manger, to His own a stranger
A Man of sorrows, tears and agony

Chorus
O how I love Him! How I adore Him
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all
The great Creator became my Savior
And all God’s fulness dwelleth in Him

What condescension, bringing us redemption
That in the dead of night, not one faint hope in sight
God, gracious, tender, laid aside His splendor
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul

Without reluctance, flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man, revealed the hidden plan
O glorious mystery, sacrifice of Calvary
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM”

And sacrificed the Lamb of God

To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God

In desperation I turned to Heaven
And spoke Your name into the night
Then through the darkness, Your loving kindness
Tore through the shadows of my soul
The work is finished, the end is written

Hallelujah, praise the one who set me free
Hallelujah, death has lost its grip on me
You have broken every chain
There’s salvation in Your name
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Who could imagine so great a mercy
What heart could fathom, such boundless grace
The God of angels stepped down from glory
To wear my sin and bear my shame
The cross has spoken I am forgiven
The King of kings calls me His own
Beautiful Savior I’m Yours forever
Jesus Christ, my living hope

Then came the morning that sealed the promise
Your buried body began to breathe
Out of the silence the roaring lion
Declared the grave has no claim on me
Jesus, Yours is the victory

And pardoned from his sin

O love of God, how rich and pure
How measureless and strong
It shall forevermore endure
The saints’ and angels’ song

When all of time shall pass away
And earthly thrones and kingdoms fall
When men who here refuse to pray
On rocks and hills and mountains call
God’s love, so sure, shall still endure
All measureless and strong
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race
The saints’ and angels’ song

Could we with ink the ocean fill
And were the skies of parchment made
Were every stalk on earth a quill
And every man a scribe by trade
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry
Nor could the scroll contain the whole
Though stretched from sky to sky

Accept the only way by God provided

Thou wilt all our burdens bear
May we ever, Lord, be bringing
All to Thee in earnest prayer
Soon in glory bright, unclouded
There will be no need for prayer
Rapture, praise, and endless worship
Will be our sweet portion there

All fear can flee for death’s dark night is overcome

For by my side, the Saviour He will stay

Through the deepest valley He will lead
Oh the night has been won, and I shall overcome!

For Jesus bled and suffered for my pardon
And He was raised to overthrow the grave
To this I hold, my sin has been defeated
Jesus now and ever is my plea
Oh the chains are released, I can sing: I am free!

With every breath I long to follow Jesus
For He has said that He will bring me home
And day by day I know He will renew me
Until I stand with joy before the throne
To this I hold, my hope is only Jesus
All the glory evermore to Him
When the race is complete, still my lips shall repeat
Yet not I, but through Christ in me!

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound
That saved a wretch like me!
I once was lost, but now am found;
Was blind, but now I see.

’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed.

Through many dangers, toils, and snares,
I have already come;
’Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far,
And grace will lead me home.

The Lord has promised good to me,
His Word my hope secures;
He will my Shield and Portion be,
As long as life endures.

Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail,
And mortal life shall cease,
I shall possess, within the veil,
A life of joy and peace.

The earth shall soon dissolve like snow,
The sun forbear to shine;
But God, who called me here below,
Will be forever mine.

When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we’d first begun.

Our load was laid on Thee;
Thou stoodest in the sinner's stead,
Didst bear all ill for me.
A victim led; Thy blood was shed;
Now there's no load for me.

Death and the curse were in our cup,
O Christ, 'twas full for Thee!
But Thou hast drained the last dark drop—
'Tis empty now for me.
That bitter cup—love drank it up;
Now blessings' draught for me.

Jehovah lifted up His rod,
O Christ, it fell on Thee!
Thou wast sore stricken of Thy God;
There's not one stroke for me.
Thy tears, Thy blood, beneath it flowed;
Thy bruising healeth me.

The tempest's awful voice was heard,
O Christ, it broke on Thee!
Thy open bosom was my ward,
It braved the storm for me.
Thy form was scarred, Thy visage marred;
Now cloudless peace for me.

Jehovah bade His sword awake,
O Christ, it woke 'gainst Thee!
Thy blood the flaming blade must slake;
Thy heart its sheath must be—
All for my sake, my peace to make;
Now sleeps that sword for me.

For me, Lord Jesus, Thou hast died,
And I have died in Thee;
Thou'rt ris'n: my bands are all untied,
And now Thou liv'st in me.
When purified, made white, and tried,
Thy glory then for me!

Life is easy when you're up on the mountain
And you've got peace of mind like you've never known.
But then things change and you're down in the valley.
Don't lose faith for you're never alone.

For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make them right.
And the God of the good times
Is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night.

You talk of faith when you're up on the mountain.
Oh but the talk comes easy when life's at its best.
But it's down in the valley of trials and temptation
That's when faith is really put to the test.

For the God on the mountain is still God in the valley.
When things go wrong, He'll make them right.
And the God of the good times
Is still God in the bad times.
The God of the day is still God in the night. (2X)

Some through the waters, some through the flood,
Some through the fire, but all through the blood;
Some through great sorrow, but God gives a song,
In the night season and all the day long.

Sometimes on the mount where the sun shines so bright,
God leads His dear children along;
Sometimes in the valley, in darkest of night,
God leads His dear children along.

Though sorrows befall us and Satan oppose,
God leads His dear children along;
Through grace we can conquer, defeat all our foes,
God leads His dear children along.

Away from the mire, and away from the clay,
God leads His dear children along;
Away up in glory, eternity’s day,
God leads His dear children along.

In the crowning day that's coming by and by.

The heav'ns shall glow with splendor,

The saints shall shine in glory,
As Christ shall them array,
The beauty of the Saviour,
Shall dazzle ev'ry eye,

We'll sin and sigh no more,

And naught but joy before,

By earnest consecration,
To walk the narrow way,
By gath'ring in the lost ones,
For whom our Lord did die,
For the crowning day that's coming by and by.

Show me the tomb where Thou wast laid,
  Tenderly mourned and wept;
Angels in robes of light arrayed
  Guarded Thee while Thou slept.

Let me like Mary, through the gloom,
  Come with a gift to Thee;
Show to me now the empty tomb,
  Lead me to Calvary.

May I be willing, Lord, to bear
  Daily my cross for Thee;
Even Thy cup of grief to share,
  Thou hast borne all for me.

Fill me, O Lord, with Thy desire
  For all that know not Thee;
Then touch my lips with holy fire,
  To speak of Calvary.

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
that calls me from a world of care,
and bids me at my Father's throne
make all my wants and wishes known.
In seasons of distress and grief,
my soul has often found relief,
and oft escaped the tempter's snare
by thy return, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
the joys I feel, the bliss I share
of those whose anxious spirits burn
with strong desires for thy return!
With such I hasten to the place
where God my Savior shows his face,
and gladly take my station there,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

Sweet hour of prayer! sweet hour of prayer!
thy wings shall my petition bear
to him whose truth and faithfulness
engage the waiting soul to bless.
And since he bids me seek his face,
believe his word, and trust his grace,
I'll cast on him my every care,
and wait for thee, sweet hour of prayer!

1 I don't know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day.
I don't borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to gray.
I don't worry o'er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I'll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.

Chorus
Many things about tomorrow,
I don't seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

Every step is getting brighter,
As the golden stairs I climb;
Every burden's getting lighter;
Every cloud is silver lined.
There the sun is always shining,
There no tear will dim the eye,
At the ending of the rainbow,
Where the mountains touch the sky. 

I don't know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the one who feeds the sparrow,
Is the one who stands by me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
And I'm covered with His blood.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord,
a wonderful Savior to me.
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock,
where rivers of pleasure I see.

Chorus:
He hideth my soul in the cleft of the rock
that shadows a dry, thirsty land.
He hideth my life in the depths of his love,
and covers me there with his hand,
and covers me there with his hand.

A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord;
he taketh my burden away.
He holdeth me up, and I shall not be moved;
he giveth me strength as my day. 

With numberless blessings each moment he crowns,
and filled with his fullness divine,
I sing in my rapture,“Oh, glory to God
for such a Redeemer as mine!” 

When clothed in his brightness, transported I rise
to meet him in clouds of the sky,
his perfect salvation, his wonderful love,
I’ll shout with the millions on high. [Refrain]
