‪腓立比书‬1:20-21 和合本  
20 照着我所切慕、所盼望的，没有一事叫我羞愧。只要凡事放胆，无论是生是死，总叫基督在我身上照常显大。   
21 因我活着就是基督，我死了就有益处。

Philippians (KJV)    
20 According to my earnest expectation and my hope, that in nothing I shall be ashamed, but that with all boldness, as always, so now also Christ shall be magnified in my body, whether it be by life, or by death.  
21 For to me to live is Christ, and to die is gain.
