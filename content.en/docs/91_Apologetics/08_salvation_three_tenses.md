Salvation in is past, present, and future in 1 Peter.

At the present time we are "foreigners" (1 Peter 1:1, 17) living in alienation and rejection in a world that killed Christ and persecutes us. But we also live in the certain expectation of vindication and deliverance from this evil world.

Jobes (2005:88) says it well: "The certainty of future salvation animates the hope in which Christians now live, making the eschatological future a present reality. This is a consolatory technique intended to relieve feelings of oppression by so closely interweaving the glories of the future with the present that the present is transformed in the thought-world of Peter's readers." (Cornerstone Biblical Commentary  – Volume 18: James, 1-2 Peter, Jude, Revelation)

The basic meaning of "ransom" is rescue or deliverance from danger, here from sin (1 Peter 1:18) and final judgment (1 Peter 1:17).

This salvation is "the result of the "ransom" paid by Christ that saved us via his "precious blood" as the "sinless, spotless Lamb of God" (1 Peter 1:18-19), who also is yet to be "revealed," bringing our final "gracious salvation" (1 Peter 1:13).

When Christ is revealed on the last day (1 Peter 1:13), our eternal salvation will also be made visible to all. The "last day" is the eschaton—the final events inaugurated by Jesus' return and final judgment (cf. Rev 19-20).

The "great expectation" is faith in the certainly that our final "inheritance" and "salvation" are a secure promise awaiting us.

Stated another way In the salvation referred to here is <b>future tense</b>, the consummation referred to as glorification of our mortal bodies, free from <b>corruption</b>, free from <b>the presence of sin</b>, free from <b>the pleasure of sin</b>. Oh happy day!

The salvation spoken of in 1 Peter 1:15 is "future tense salvation" culminating in <b>the glorification of our bodies</b>. We received our <b>justification</b> at the moment we believed (past tense salvation). We are receiving our <b>sanctification</b>, namely victory over sin and growth in the Christian life now (present tense salvation). We will yet receive that part of salvation which awaits us in Glory (future tense salvation).

>Barclay:  
>"Salvation is a many-sided thing. In it there is deliverance from danger, deliverance from disease, deliverance from condemnation and deliverance from sin. And it is that, and nothing less than that, to which the Christian can look forward at the end."

The unsaved have their “glory” now, but it will be followed by eternal suffering away from the glory of God (2Th 1:3, 4, 5, 6, 7,8, 9, 10).

In the light of this, ponder (2Co 4:17, 18)—and rejoice!

>For momentary, light affliction is producing for us an eternal weight of glory far beyond all comparison, while we look not at the things which are seen, but at the things which are not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things which are not seen are eternal.
