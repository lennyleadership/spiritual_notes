> <i>"The eyes of the Lord run to and fro throughout the whole earth, to show himself strong in the behalf of them whose heart is perfect toward him" (2 Chron. 16:9).</i>

God is looking for a man, or woman, whose heart will be always set on Him, and who will trust Him for all He desires to do. God is eager to work more mightily now than He ever has through any soul. The clock of the centuries points to the eleventh hour.

"The world is waiting yet to see what God can do through a consecrated soul." Not the world alone, but God Himself is waiting for one, who will be more fully devoted to Him than any who have ever lived; who will be willing to be nothing that Christ may be all; who will grasp God's own purposes; and taking His humility and His faith, His love and His power, will, without hindering, continue to let God do exploits. --C. H. P.

"There is no limit to what God can do with a man, providing he will not touch the glory."

In an address given to ministers and workers after his ninetieth birthday, George Mueller spoke thus of himself: "I was converted in November, 1825, but I only came into <b>the full surrender</b> of the heart four years later, in July, 1829. The love of money was gone, the love of place was gone, the love of position was gone, the love of worldly pleasures and engagements was gone. God, God alone became my portion. I found my all in Him; I wanted nothing else. And by the grace of God this has remained, and has made me a happy man, an exceedingly happy man, and it led me to care only about the things of God. I ask affectionately, my beloved brethren, have you fully surrendered the heart to God, or is there this thing or that thing with which you are taken up irrespective of God? I read a little of the Scriptures before, but preferred other books; but since that time the revelation He has made of Himself has become unspeakably blessed to me, and I can say from my heart, God is an infinitely lovely Being. Oh, be not satisfied until in your own inmost soul you can say, God is an infinitely lovely Being!' --Selected

I pray to God this day to make me an extraordinary Christian. --Whitefield.

  親愛的讀者阿，上帝正在尋找一個人──一個肯全心傾向祂的人，一個肯完全順服祂的人。上帝切望在這個人身上動一件重要的工程──祂要重用祝福這個人，比以前靈界上一切的偉人更甚；因為這世代的鐘已經瞄準在十一點上了。  
  
  世界在等待──要看上帝藉著一個獻身的聖徒能成功何等大的事！不獨世界，就是上帝自己也在等待一個人出來──一個肯完全委身於祂比一切先聖更甚的人，一個願意把自己算作糞土，看基督是一切的人；一個能體會上帝心意的人；一個主的謙卑、主的信心、主的愛、主的能力，而不肯阻止上帝的計劃，一直讓上帝藉著他工作的人。──C.H.P.  
  
  一個被上帝重用的人，只要不偷享上帝的榮耀，上帝在他身上的祝福是無限量的。  
  
  莫勒在九十歲那年，對一班教師和工人所發表的一篇演說裡面，有一段講到他自己的見證：「我是一千八百二十五年十一月裡得救的，但是一直到四年以後，一千八百二十九年七月裡，纔<b>完全順服</b><label class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><span class="sidenote">我的信仰从守规矩到真实地活出生命走了二十七年 (1996 - 2023)</span>。那時候，愛錢財的心沒有了，愛都市的心沒有了，愛地位的心沒有了，愛屬世的娛樂的心也沒有了。上帝，惟有上帝，是我所愛的。我在祂裡面找到了一切，所以我不再需要其他的東西了。感謝上帝，靠著祂的恩典，這傾向一直存留到今天，使我終身得成一個快樂的人──一個極快樂的人；這傾向一直存到今天，這傾向也叫我只愛慕屬天的事物。現在，我親愛的弟兄們阿，讓我誠誠懇懇地問你們一句話，你們有沒有完全順服上帝呢？你們所做的是不是還有這件或者那件沒有顧到上帝的心呢？我以前只讀一點點聖經，我寧願多讀些別的書籍；但是自從那時候起，上帝的話對於我便成了說不盡的福樂，我能夠從心坎中發出喊聲來說，上帝眞可愛極了。弟兄們阿，你們不要自滿自足，我眞希望在你們心的最深處也能夠叫說，上帝眞可愛極了！」──選  
  
  我今天求上帝叫我作一個超凡的基督人。──惠特費（Whitefield）
