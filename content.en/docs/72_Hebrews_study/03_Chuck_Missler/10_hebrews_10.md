Well, we're continuing our survey exploration of the epistle of the Hebrews and we're in session eleven focusing on chapter ten. And as you know, the first seven chapters was all about Jesus, presenting him as the new and better deliverer, better than Moses, better Aaron and so forth.  

After a priest, after the order of Melchizedek, then we're in the second session, a better covenant, a better sanctuary, and a better sacrifice. And we'll have finally to wrap up the practical side of all of this.  

But last time in chapter nine we focused on the sanctuary that the sanctuary that is presently operative is in heaven with our high priest there, in contrast to the Levitical high priest who officiated in the temple on earth.  

And this has all been superseded is the point. And chapter nine really continues in chapter ten. That theme will continue in our early part of chapter ten tonight, but then we're going to shift when we get to verse 18 of chapter ten.  

We're going to get into the beginning of what some people label as the next major or third major section of the book, the practical applications. And interestingly enough, that section opens with the fourth of five warnings and many people treat these five warnings as sort of interruptions of the sweep of the author and quite the contrary, there really is key points as we begin to understand the meaning of the whole epistle.  

So I want to highlight something else here. Remember that when we were in chapter six of Hebrews, that's well known as the riddle in the New Testament. Hebrews is considered one of the most difficult doctrinal studies in the entire New Testament.  

And Hebrews six is probably the biggest problem within this epistle in the minds of many. And we dwelt on that back there in six. But there's another tough passage that becomes a close cousin of. And that's a passage in chapter ten.  

So we're going to encounter the fourth of five warnings in this session tonight between these two passages, between six and ten, of course, chapter seven, eight and nine, which introduce and emphasize more than any other place in the Bible, the priestly work of Jesus Christ.  

When we think of high priests, we learn all about the high priests of the liturgical system. But we're here are speaking of something that has superseded that and that priestly work of Jesus Christ avails for you and me.  

We're going to get into some very heavy apostasy verses and let's not lose sight as to why he Christ, ever liveth to make intercessions for you and me. That whole build up and key point was put there before we get to chapter ten as sort of a preparation, if you will.  

And I want to warn you in advance, if you're worried about chapter ten, some verses, chapter ten, the very fact you're worrying about it demonstrates they probably don't have nothing, anything to worry about.  

It's the people that aren't worrying about it that are the worry. Okay? And you'll see what I mean as we get into this. And I want you to remember, I know I sound very repetitive here, but everybody that gets confused about the book gets confused because they forget to whom it was written.  

It was written to Christian believers. These happen to come out of Judaism. Yes, they're Jewish, but the point is they're Jewish believers. Throughout the Epistle is let us, let us, let us the writer puts himself in the same category.  

These are believers. We're not talking about unbelievers in this picture, okay? Need to understand that. And he constantly demonstrates that Christ fulfilled and set aside the things of the past. He reviews all these things of the past to set them aside, to put them behind us.  

The sacrifices have been paid. All the sacrifices on the altars and throughout the whole Old Testament were anticipatory examples or models or teaching illustrations. Of the ultimate sacrifice that was paid once and for all on the cross.  

The rituals have all been fulfilled. The old things were only emblematic, if I can use that term, pointing to the shedding of the blood of our Lord and Savior once and all. For sin once you understand who he is and the blood that was shed.  

It colors everything, if you will. Well, let's jump into chapter ten, verse one. For the Law having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image of the things, having a shadow of the things, good things to come and not the very image of the things, can never, with those sacrifices which they offered year by year continually make the comers there unto perfect.  

First word four. This ties to our previous chapter. You could best probably teach this if we had time without a chapter break. This is just continuing the theme from last time in chapter nine. And so he's hammering still the cleaning up on the sacrifice issue here.  

And this begins the explanation of what he'd been saying from chapter nine, verses eleven to 28, if you'd be keeping notes. Okay. Having a shadow of good things to come and not the very image. There are two different Greek words being used here for shadow.  

The first one, the shadow things, means a pale shadow that is in contrast to a sharper, distinct one. It's a fuzzy glimpse. It's not a sharp image. In fact, the other word means the icon, which means a true representation, which it's not.  

In other words, the Law was having a shadow of good things to come, but not the very image. In other words, it's an imperfect representation is what he's saying. It can never, with those sacrifices which they offered year by year, continually make the comers there unto perfect.  

That's its problem, making it perfect. The Law could only show us our need. It could not repair that need. The law couldn't make us perfect. It set a standard we can't meet, and so it shows us the need for a sacrifice in the first place.  

That's why, when the law was given, the sacrifice were instituted, because they knew they wouldn't keep the law. So at least there was a remedy. But not for all sin. There were some sins that had no remedy and we'll come to those.  

But the main point is, the law gave us hint of what's coming. But it could never, even with all the sacrifices that were done again and again, year after year, could make the comers to the sacrifice perfect or complete.  

If the sacrifices could have made them perfect, they would never have to be repeated. Right. The very fact that they had to be repeated daily, year after year, et cetera, shows that they were intended to be a temporary teaching tool for the ultimate that they are pointing to.  

He Continues verse two. For then would they not have ceased to be offered, because that the worshippers, once purged, should have had no more conscience of sins. In other words, if your sins were really dealt with, you could come away with a clean conscience.  

No, they were just covered. Otherwise, wouldn't they have been ceased to be offered? The very repetition of the sacrifice shows their insufficiency and if if they'd been sufficient, they of course wouldn't have to be repeated.  

And it's interesting, by the way, that the tense of the Greek in here shows that the Levitical sacrifices were still continuing at the point he wrote this, which means this was written prior to destruction of the temple in 70 Ad.  

So it's a dating boundary, if you will, but continuing. But in those sacrifices, there is a remembrance again, made of sins every year. So every year we're reminded they didn't work. We're still. We still have the sin hanging over us every year, every Yom Kippur, the yearly sacrifice they did this year after year after year, and they still never accomplished the element.  

There remained something the law and the sacrifice could never do. That is make perfect, which in the context of the Book of Hebrews, means to bring to spiritual maturity. The theme from this, from first to the last verse is one primary thrust coming to spiritual maturity, not to become a Christian.  

They're already Christians. The issue before each one of these verses and points and so forth is to bring the readers, the listeners, to spiritual maturity. So if you're not a Christian, this has no meaning to you, but if you're a Christian, it challenges you to take the next step.  

I often ask an audience, how many are saved? And all the hands go up, and I say, Good. What have you done with it? Because he saved you for a purpose. We tend to celebrate accepting Christ as a victory someone's led to the Lord.  

That's not a home run, it's a first base deal. The idea is to continue on to maturity. And that's what this epistle is all about. Remember? Now we read in the New Covenant. It was back in Jeremiah 31, but it was emphasized in chapter eight of Hebrews a few chapters ago that under the new covenant, god would remember their sins no more.  

That's a once and for all deal, not repeated every year. Okay, then he continues to explain, it is not possible that the blood of bulls and goats could take away sins. Wow. If you're Jewish, that's a blow.  

You have centuries of these laborious offerings. They didn't take away sins. They covered sins pending the final sacrifice. And as you see here, the Old Testament sins were only covered, not taken away.  

The word is kafar in the Hebrew. In the Old Testament, that's a word for covering, the same word that was used when Noah was told to build his ark. He was told to cover the ark with bitumen or tar or a pitch, if you will, to cover the word atonement.  

And cover is the same word in the Hebrew. It means to cover. Doesn't do away with it, it just temporarily patches it, so to speak. In Noah's case, the gover was not taken away, it was only covered by the tar and so forth, wherefore when he cometh into the world, he saith, sacrifice and offering thou wouldst not, but a body hast thou prepared me.  

The animals did not offer their blood in perfect obedience and faith. The animals didn't volunteer for the duty. Right. They didn't do it voluntarily. It was necessary for the Messiah to come and do it voluntarily.  

There's this wherefore that's the reason the Messiah had to come into the world by way of the Incarnation. All these sacrifices were just anticipatory, where the Creator himself would deign to enter his creation, become a man, fulfill the requirement and go to his death to pay the price.  

Bizarre idea until we understand the whole picture. Now, here the writer quotes Psalm 40, verses six through eight to make his point. It's going to be laced all through the coming verses here. So let's just take a look at it.  

Psalm 40, verses six through eight. And this is our style. The scrolls imply Old Testament. The other things I just do to remind you. We're going back in the Old Testament here. Psalm 40, verse six to eight.  

Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire. My nearest hast thou open. I'll come back to that. That doesn't mean what you think. It means. Burnt offering and sin offering hast thou not required. Then said, I lo I come.  

In the volume of the book it is written of me I delight to do thy will, o my God yea, thy law is in with my heart. Who's speaking can't hear. Jesus. Good for you. The volume of the book is written of me.  

One of the discoveries you need to make personally is the discovery. It's not something you do overnight, something you do in a lifetime, but discover that everything in the book is written of Jesus Christ.  

All the little funny rules, regulations, subtleties, even the encryptions hidden in the genealogies. Astonishing. Astonishing. Lo. I said I come in. The volume of book is written of me. Verse chapter 40, verse seven.  

And this literally means that every page of the Bible speaks of Jesus Christ on every page. But there's other phrase in here that deserves a little comment, especially because of where we live. He says, Mine ears hast thou opened or pierced?  

Is what it really says. What is he talking? He's talking about a well known procedure within that culture for a bond slave. If you were a slave paying off a debt, let's assume that you were indentured for seven years to pay off a debt or something.  

At the end of the seven years, you're free to go. You've done it. You've finished your service. But often in that period of time, you became so devoted to the family that you chose to be adopted as a bond slave.  

Adulos. And this is what Psalm 46 is alluding to mine ears hast thou opened or pierced. It really means digged. Mine ears have been digged, if you will, as referring to this concept by choice. And so if you chose to be a bond slave, they would take you to the doorpost of the house and pierce your ear to the doorpost with a shoemaker like an awe, like an ice pick, a shoemaker's.  

Awe. And from that point on, you probably wore an earring of pride because you were a slave. That was you volunteered to spend the rest of your days serving that family. You were proud of that. This was a privilege that you asked for and they granted.  

And so this is what we call a bond slave. Why is this so important? Because both John and Paul. Speak of themselves as bonslays of Jesus Christ, meaning they're dedicated for the rest of their days to serve him.  

Now, why is this so important to us? Well, first of all, the word all appears only twice in the bible, and it has to do with this procedure. But it's important to us. NAN and I anyway, is that when we came to lane curtelin is a French label.  

As most of you know, the name of the tribe of Indians here was named by the French Canadian rappers because they regarded them as sharp traders. And so they named them the heart of the all. They were sharp traders was the idea.  

Their concept sort of a backhanded compliment. But to us, anybody with a biblical perspective, the coeur d'alene refers to the heart of the bonslave. Heart of the bonslave. And my hand is up, right? Okay.  

So we're committed without reservation forever to our master. And this is what's being alluded to in psalm 40, where my knees have been digged and Jesus says, for I said, I lo, I come. Jesus Christ is talking here, as you know from that verse, and that's exciting.  

He's coming. Our master is coming. We're in his service until then. And that's something that we look to with great anticipation. I want to pause and give you some hermeneutical insight, hermeneutics being the study of interpretation.  

Most of the quotes in the new testament are from the Greek translation of the old testament, interestingly enough, because that was the commonly used thing. And it's interesting, as you study these quotes in the new testament from the Greek old testament, you discover the authors in general attribute unqualified divine authority to the Greek translation of the old testament.  

That gives us comfort as we use that as a basis. And sometimes they base their argument in the new testament on a single word in the septuagint. Give you one example. I don't think it's the one I used here, but there's others you can look up in your notes, and that is Isaiah 714, that he'd be born of a virgin.  

In the Hebrew, the word is alma, and some people say, well, that could mean something other than virgin. No, septuagint. It's Greek, and it's clearly a virgin. It's less ambiguous. So the point is, often this is true.  

The septuagint is amplifying. The septuagint was used by them as English is today, and there's lots of examples of that. That was one of them I just gave you. Some variations attempt more accuracy than that.  

Sometimes they'll quote from the septuagint, but they'll vary it to make it more clear, a little more precise, little more accurate. And there's examples in your notes. I won't go through them all here.  

Some are paraphrased to highlight a specific application from the septuagint. There are some quotes that summarize several passages. They'll quote from several pages, but they'll weave them together into a summary.  

So we learn hermeneutically. We understand interpretation from the way they interpreted the septuagint. You with me? Okay. In some cases, there's only an illusion, and it's not intended to be a complete translation.  

You follow me? It's just an example. Sometimes the Holy Spirit rewords the restatement as a human author might. Sometimes, as a human author, you might quote somebody, but you might reword it to make it more clear.  

You with me? Okay. Now I'm going to show you some interesting examples as we go through this a little later. Let's summarize the sacrifice thing. Sacrifices started in Eden. The first intimation of the Plan of Redemption was when Adam and Eve put aprons of skins of leaves, and they were replaced by coats of skins by God himself.  

Why? Teaching them about the shedding of innocent blood. They'd be covered. And you say that's a pun. Yes, exactly. That's a deliberate, connotative transfer to make a point. And that Plan of Redemption would involve without the shedding of blood, there's no remission of sins.  

The first example, that is Cain and Abel. Cain offered the fruits of a cursed ground and Abel offered the ordained sacrifice of a lamb. The fact that he was a shepherd and Cain was a farmer confuses the picture to most people.  

It's got nothing to do with it. What this teaches us is that Abel was following instructions, cain was not. He was doing it his way. And so it was his sacrifice, not his character, that's at issue. That's going to be alluded to in the next chapter.  

We'll come to that now. Before the law was given, the head of the household was the family priest. Before Exodus 20, the head of each household did the Passover land. Passover is not a Levitical offering.  

Did you realize that Passover was done in the Passover long before that was Exodus twelve. The law has been given till Exodus 20. During that interval, it's the head of the house that's the priest of the family.  

After the law is given, the priests alone offered sacrifices because you were not allowed in the temple, you were not allowed in the tabernacle. You went to the gate and you offered what you wanted and gave it to him, and he'd do it for you.  

The priest did the offering, again, being instructional here. Christ is our high priest and he's also our sacrifice. He's our penal sacrifice, emphasizing Galatians three and two, Corinthians five. He's our substitution.  

It was voluntary, it was redemptive, it was propitiatory, it was reconciling, it was efficacious, and it also revealed the whole situation. And I won't go through all of this here, but they'll be in your notes so that you can dig through these at a time.  

You want to make a careful study of how many ways Jesus was our sacrifice, and I'm indebted. These are the kinds of notes you'll find in most study Bibles, like Schofield and others. That's where I crib this one.  

And by the way, this is not the only passage that clearly implies that animal sacrifices were temporary, nor is it the only passage that emphasized the sacrifices were useless without faith. That's through isaiah one.  

Jeremiah six, hosea six. Amos five. In other words, here's at least four places in the Old Testament that says this very thing. This is not a doctrinal contrivance of the writer. It's fascinating to me to see that Paul chose not to sign this epistle for a number of reasons we've reviewed, but he bases his entire argument on texts that his readers accepted as foundation.  

You get the point. The points he's making are inferences you draw from the Old Testament, not from some New Testament revelation. Okay? It was God's will to arrange the final sacrifice in this manner by preparing a body with which he could die, into which he could die within which he could die for man.  

Now, by the way, here's a sobering thought. To go through a sacrifice today, if all this is true, is to trod underfoot the blood of Jesus Christ. Wow. Hebrews, verse six. In burnt offerings and sacrifice for sin thou hast no pleasure.  

He's contrasting what the annual sacrifice would not do with what the blood of Jesus could do. From verses five through seven, he's going to point out that God considered the once and for all acceptable sacrifice, and that only sacrifice was that he comes through perfect obedience through faith.  

In other words, Jesus sacrificed, but applies to us through obedience of faith. And then said, I lo, I come in. The volume book is written of me to do Thy will. This, of course, is recapping verse seven of of Psalm 40, verse eight of Hebrews ten above, when he said, sacrifice an offering and burn offerings and offering for sin, thou wouldst not, neither hadst pleasure therein which are offered by the law.  

And what he's quoting here from is from Psalm 40, verse six. It's interesting to realize a third of the Torah, a third of the books of Moses are spent discussing these offerings and sacrifices that were to be made, and yet they no longer obtain.  

And so the sacrifice of Jesus was a voluntary sacrifice. It came with obedience. The Old Testament sacrifice are contrasted with obedience. They were required by the law, and the animals didn't volunteer.  

The animals did not obey, but Jesus did. And they did not go to the death as an act of personal obedience on their own. That sounds funny to say, but the point he's making is the contrast. And so these sacrifices didn't please God.  

They were just his way of getting people to understand what was coming. No obedience was involved in part of animals. They were offered entirely on the basis of the law of Moses. And when the Messiah, God the Son, said to God the Father, lo, I am come to do your will, he stated that he was coming willingly and obedient.  

To be what? What was he coming for? To be that final sacrifice. That's, again, I try to emphasize perhaps too often, but Mel Gibson's book movie, I should say the Passion, that it has two deficiencies, conspicuous ones.  

One is, it implies that the crucifixion was a tragedy. No, it was an achievement. Jesus came to do that and to be the final sacrifice for sin. And the second thing, of course, the book keeps him, the movie fails to do is to present who Jesus Christ really is.  

I'm not sure how he would have done that. But the point is that's missing that's the whole point of the whole thing, actually. Anyway, verse nine. Then he said, Lo, I come to do thy will, O God. He taketh away the first that he may establish the second.  

What's he taking? It what's he doing? Away with the law. The first covenant. Yes, exactly right. To establish the second. Again, this is quoted from Psalm 40, verse eight. And his death. The sacrifice of Mosaic covenant were taken away.  

The second was brought in, the one sacrifice upon which the new covenant is established. That's where we get the New Testament gets its name. It's from this whole issue. He take away the first that he may establish the second.  

And again, here is another clear statement of something that's funny. You can't get this across so many people as Christians, they get enamored with the Old Testament, and that's healthy, that's good.  

And they start studying the Jewish feast days and try to understand what they all mean. And that's wonderful and fruitful and worth doing. But it's interesting how often from all of that they start finding themselves trying to keep the Torah, getting back under the law.  

And to do that means they don't understand the purpose and accomplishments of Christ. And it's disturbing to realize that to even consider that is an undoing of what Christ came to undo. Or in other words, okay, double undoing.  

There I'm not sure that's in the Greek. I'm kidding. Okay. Verse ten by the which we will be sanctified through the offering of the body of Jesus Christ, once for all. It's interesting. In the Greek text, the author uses a perfect participle with a finite verb.  

What does that mean? That emphasizes the believers are in a permanent, continuous state of sanctification. Your justification is once and for all, but you are then in a permanent state of sanctification, some making more progress than others.  

They've been made permanently holy in the sight of God that is declared justified. Okay? It's his blood that saves them and sanctifies them. Why? Because the offering up of the body of Jesus was once and for all.  

That's why justification is once and for all for all of you. It's past tense. It's been done. We'll talk more about sanctification. All this unfolds here, every priest, standeth, daily ministering and offering, sometimes oftentimes the same sacrifice which can never take away sins.  

They do this daily, every day, every year, et cetera. This time the focus isn't on Yom Kippur once a year, it's on the daily ritual that they do off times the same sacrifice over and over, every day, year after year.  

The emphasis of a writer here is on repetition. That's one reason I haven't taken you down through a review of all the different offerings. Because the whole point is they're all behind us, they're all done.  

And they stand. The Levitical priest stand, day by day. There's no place to sit, as we saw in the tabernacle. And standing means they're unfinished state of their work. They're never done the same sacrifice, no matter how many times they're offered, could never take away sins, they could only cover it.  

But this man, Jesus Christ, after he had offered one sacrifice for sins forever, sat down at the right hand of God. The Levitical priest never sat down. Jesus sat down at the right hand of the Father.  

Key point, he offered one sacrifice. Jesus is the opposite of the Levitical priests. He's the one in contrast to the many of the Levitical priests. And by the way, the Greek word here is the errorist, and emphasized it's once and for all, offering in contrast to the repeated offerings.  

Even the grammar emphasize this his work, Jesus Christ's work is effective forever. That means he didn't just die all the sins up till the cross, he died all the sins in advance, for all of them forever.  

And because he's finished with his work, he's now seated. Where? On his throne? In heaven. Right? No good for you. Where is he seated? By the right hand of the Father. But he's seated is the point the guy's making here.  

He's no longer standing like vicar. He can sit down because his work is finished. He's going to hammer that away through from, henceforth expecting till enemies be made, his footstool. See, his present position is that he's now in Heaven.  

That's. Where's Jesus right now? We're going to visit Israel. We'll see the empty tomb. Is he there? No, he's in heaven now, henceforth expecting that's waiting until all his enemies are made, the footstool under his feet.  

In the fulfillment of Psalm 110, verse one. Remember the whole 110 thing we went over several times. Okay? The reason Jesus can sit and wait for his enemies to become his footstool is because his work is finished.  

He's sitting, waiting for the right time. His father will say, go get him. That's why, until his enemies make his footstool. Seven Contrasts to give you a summary of the last four verses. Many priests, in contrast to one priest, they are standing.  

He sat down. They had to sacrifice daily, but he sacrificed on one single day. They sacrificed many times. He sacrificed only once. They had to offer many sacrifice, but he had to offer only one sacrifice.  

They accomplished a temporary atonement, but he a permanent, eternal one. And their sacrifice only covered sins, but his sacrifice actually took them away. And some of these sounds like repetitions. They're not really the precision of this analysis.  

I'm indebted to Arnold Fruchtenbaum. Who else would be that picky? Ewan. But being a Hebrew specialist, I lean on Him heavily for this in these very sharp, very sharp analysts. For by one offering he hath perfected forever.  

Them that are sanctified hath perfected forever. OOH, that's a wonderful sound. There's a verse that's good for showing the contrast between position and practice. See, earlier he dealt with the positional sanctification justification.  

That is, they're not perfect because of what they really are, but because of what they are in Christ. If you have accepted Christ, your passport to heaven is stamped. Admitted, there's a work still going on, however, called practical sanctification.  

The Holy Spirit is within believers, slowly conforming them to be more and more to the image of God. Because your justification doesn't change you, it just allows you entrance to heaven when the time comes.  

That's done. He did it. In the meantime, you should be growing day by day, inch by inch, whatever. Towards spiritual maturity. And that's what this epistle is really hammering about here. There's another concept here that's worth mentioning in this whole justification thing, and that's the certificate of debt.  

There's another model hinted here that I wanted to just touch on, so we're not blind to this. In the old ways, in Roman Empire and elsewhere, there was an acknowledgement of debt for sin and the debts not paid by sacrifices each year, as Yom Kippur are made for their sins, but only extends the penalty for another year.  

That's what Yom Kippur did. There's another model hinted here, and that's the certificate of debt. And Paul speaks of the handwriting of ordinances that was against us, or phrasing it another way the certificate of debt was against us.  

We use the expression ourselves that he owes a debt to society. When someone creates a criminal act, it's as if he owes a debt to society. In those days, they actually document. When you were in court and got deemed guilty, you had a certificate debt that you had to have paid an actual document, and it was a penal or legal or criminal term.  

And we use the same terminology today. Guy was his debt. What the jailer would do? He would keep the certificate of debt. And as you earned your sentence, if you were sentenced for five years each year, he would sign off a year till you did the five years.  

If along the way you escaped what was unpaid, the jailer had to pay. That gave him diligence. That's why that jailer. Remember when Paul, that was open, he thought they'd all escaped. He was ready to kill.  

He said, don't do that. We're all here. That blew him away. They didn't leave. They were singing songs and the jailer came to Christ. You know the story in acts, but okay. Now, if the criminal escaped, as I say, the jailer was then responsible.  

When the debt was finally paid, it would be stamped or written to telesty. It is finished. Paid in full is equivalent term, and he would give that to you. And you then had that as proof that you'd paid your debt to society.  

That was their approach. To avoiding what we call double jeopardy today. And so that's why Paul speaks of our certificate of debt having been paid for us by Christ. Why? Because the wages of sin is death.  

Christ's death paid for that, and he did it in full on the cross. His last words on the cross were Tetelestai paid in full, which in the King James, of course, is translated, it is finished, and so are paid in full.  

Debt is discussed here because that debt is acknowledged and rolled. Their debt in the analytical thing is rolled over each year. Ours is paid once and for all. How precious that is. So let's continue in verse 15, whereof the Holy Ghost also is a witness to us.  

For after that he had said before this is the covenant that I will make with them. After those days, saith the Lord, I'll put my laws in their hearts and in their minds will I write them and their sins and iniquities will I remember.  

How long? No more. He's a quoting. If you recognize the quote is from Jeremiah, the new covenant passage jeremiah 31 31. It's easy to remember. 31 is the number of God in the Hebrew, right? L Jeremiah 31.  

31 is the is the new covenant verse just a way to remember that Holy Ghost is a witness to us. And 31, it's all the way from 31 through 34. Now, where the remission of these is there is no more offering for sin.  

If you try to offer for sin, you're trotting Jesus Christ. This presents the conclusion of the entire discussion. Verse 18 ends this whole discussion we've been having since Jesus brought perfection and brought complete forgiveness.  

Sin, as far as God is concerned, cannot even be remembered. So it's great. What further need is there for Levitical sacrifices? They're over. They're behind us. They're done. He's trying to tell his listeners to get out of that system, or you're jeopardizing yourself before your king and you're going to expose yourself to risk of life and limb, as you'll see in a minute.  

And so with that statement, the author concludes the first major part of the book of Hebrews. So we got that behind us. So now we go from that part to the second part of this chapter, which is from verse 18 to the end of the chapter.  

But it includes a warning, warning number four out of five. So let's just jump in as we go here. The practical application of the walk of the believer. The first major division author of Hebrews was from chapter one through chapter ten, verse 18.  

That was all the theological stuff, okay? He showed the superiority, the preeminence of the Son to the three pillars of Judaism angels, the Moses, the Levitical priests. Okay? The second part of the book that we're now entering, he's going to deal with the practical application of the preeminence of the Son and the walk of the believer.  

And that'll continue to the end of the book, verse 19 of chapter ten. Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest by the blood of Jesus whoa, wait a minute. Who could enter the holy of holies?  

Only the high priest. When on Yom Kippur, after great ceremonial preparation, do you have to understand the awe that they held that into? You couldn't even enter the tabernacle unless you were a Levite.  

You couldn't enter the holy place unless you were a son of Aaron, and you couldn't enter the holy of holies unless you were the high priest. And you could only do that on Yom Kippur. You get the picture?  

He's saying now because of all this that you've had, brethren, he's putting himself in that same category. These are believers. Having therefore brethren boldness to enter into the holiest holy of holies by the blood of the Lord Jesus, is therefore connected to the past.  

Of course, the whole ten chapter previous, brethren. He's putting himself in that. Their fellow believers have boldness to enter. They now have the privilege into the holy of holies in heaven through a Melchizedekan high priest, not a Levitical high priest.  

Different situation. He's a king and a priest. And <b>Jesus did not have the qualification to be a Levite</b>. He was in the tribe of Judah, not Levi. Different deal. Here. You and I are on the same plane of privilege as that of the Old Testament high priest.  

Wow, that's bizarre. Now we go back and read those again more carefully. I won't do it tonight. You do it yourself. Having therefore, brethren and whole boldness to enter into the holiest holies by blood of Jesus, by a new and living way which he hath consecrated for us through the veil, that is to say, his flesh, a new way.  

This is based on the new Covenant. And by the way, the word for new is a strange word, prosphotos, which literally means new in the sense of having just been slaughtered or freshly killed, meaning recently made.  

It's new in that sense. You lose that in the English. It shows up in the Greek by a new and living way. See, he didn't die. The high priest died and somebody replaced him and so forth. No, we have a living way based on the living fellowship with a living person.  

We have a living person there. And having a high priest over the house of God, let us draw near with a true heart in full assurance of our faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience and our bodies washed with pure water.  

There's a double reference here that will be familiar if you understand your Old Testament. Now understand the sovereign power of this high priest over the house of God. This is where he's more like Melchizedek, not like Levi.  

Levi was just the servant. This guy has sovereign power over this high priest. He's a high priest after the order of Melchizedek. Melchizedek was a king and a priest. Remember, we went through all that in previous chapters.  

This is the first of a series of let us phrases. We're going to talk about that in a minute. But let us paul's in the same category. Let us draw an ear. That's a ritual term. You can't serve God until you have learned to worship him.  

You want to understand how to worship him, I encourage you to study that carefully. And my wife has several books that are very practical and helpful in that area. If you want to get some insights there, the Greek is here.  

The present imperative tense. In other words, continue drawing near would be a more precise translation. And with what? A true heart word here in the Greek means of real devotion, to have sincerity without superficiality.  

And I think that speaks that thus. It speaks for itself, having our hearts sprinkled. That's an Old Testament Idiom. Speaking of blood, right? This is Levitical imagery. The blood was sprinkled in that system.  

And by the way, the same word in the septuagint is used for the induction of a priest into his office. He's sprinkled. The sprinkling of blood is a form of authorizing and sanctifying. It okay? Now, the washed is a different concept.  

This is also a Levitical illusion to luo, to bathe. And this is referring to the cleansing as a result of having been regenerated. So you and I both need to be sprinkled. That's a once and for all atonement blood of Jesus Christ.  

We also need a daily bathing in the word of God. That's the thought that's taken for granted behind this. For someone that's familiar with the Old Testament styling here, okay? And the same word here is used for the bathing of a priest, consecration purposes and on so forth.  

And so he would be washed or bathed. It was analogous in a sense, to our ritual baptism, in a sense, the lettuce phrase. There are three of these lettuce phrases in the following three verses, starting verse 19 that we should have the boldness standard of the holiest by the blood of Jesus, by new and living way which he's consecrated for us through the veil that his where he says veil the flesh.  

His flesh was torn, and the veil was torn. Let us. We now have a high priest that's over the house of God and we have these three letters, phrases and they're not for those guys, they're for us not let us you guys let us guys, if I can butcher the grammar here a little, okay?  

The writer is including himself here. I want you also notice another emphasis here. I just want to get it clear. It's going to be emphasized as we go further, and that is the Holy Spirit's making it clear that the believer should not be in isolation.  

You don't do this on your own, by yourself all the time. You may do it, there's a place for that. You also get in a small group and one of the dangers of small groups, they tend to be insular. No, you need to network between the groups.  

We should not forsake the assembling together. He's going to expressly command that shortly let us together, not individually. And there's three of these one to draw near in faith that's our relationship toward God.  

Let's draw near in hope that's for ourselves we can't live without hope and draw near in love, and that's for others. So it's our relation three let us toward God, to ourselves and to others. Okay? Verse 23 let us hold fast to the profession of a faith without wavering for he is faithful that promised that's hope.  

Let us consider one another to provoke unto love and to good works let us consider awkward to perceive, observe, understand to consider attentively to make very careful investigation or careful study of what?  

One another. One another have you really studied your friends needs? There's an invitation here for us to seriously investigate, do a careful study, consider attentively one another why? To provoke unto love and good works.  

The way to show love to the brethren is by doing good works for them. Talks cheap, right? Not forsaking the assembly of ourselves. Here it is expressly, often quoted verse very important to understand not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together as the manner of some is, but exhorting one another.  

And so much the more as ye see the day approaching. Interesting emphasis here. This verse is often quoted forsake not the assembling of ourselves. Notice what the emphasis is. When is this most important?  

As you see the day approaching, it shouldn't surprise us to see the real body of believers increasingly meeting in homes. Businessmen after breakfast on Thursdays, whatever. Finding small groups to get in the word of God, we're finding them, not they're assembling themselves together.  

And as they see a day approach, it'll increase. Not forsaking that. And as the day approaches, it's the end times where we need to stick together, abandoning our divisions over non essentials. And I love the quote that my wife has in her ministry lobby.  

It's a quote from Augustine that in essentials unity, in non essentials liberty, but in all things agape. That's attributed to Augustine, but I think it says it all. We're going to include that in our handbook next time.  

We have our statement of faith, but right, we'll say our philosophy approach I think we'll call it something like that as we see the day approaching. All of us here, I think, are familiar with our study of strategic trends and we get a sense from that that we're getting in exciting times, right?  

And this is for the tape of two. I'll reemphasize one more time the most preposterous idea that I can imagine making publicly. And if you believe what I tell you now, you're going to flunk the course.  

I want you to challenge this statement. I'm going to suggest to you that you and I are being plunged into a period of time about which the Bible says more than it does about any other period of time in human history, including the time that Jesus walked the shores of Galilee or climbed the mountains of Judea.  

Now, to challenge that preposterous statement, you've got to do two things. You've got to find out what the Bible says, not what Chuck Misler says or whoever. Find out for yourself what the Bible really says.  

That's not hard to do. It takes a little work. Yes. Second thing, thing used to be hard is not today. Find out what's really going on and you won't do that on the 10:00 news. You need to do a little homework and there are resources around that's one reason we have our proprietary database for all our students and all of that to be able to do that quickly and with penetration and with relevance.  

But the more you know about what's going on and the more you know your Bible, the more you realize there's a convergence not of one thing, of over a dozen that are converging on our near horizon. I'm not setting dates.  

I'm just saying it's still time. There's still opportunities to improve your own report card before the king returns. And so now the listeners of this epistle were approaching 70 Ad. The judgment of Jerusalem, where the temple was destroyed.  

Because of what? Because the national rejection of their Messiah. Jesus so identifies it in Luke 19 at the triumphal entry. He wept over Jerusalem because you didn't recognize this thy day, the day that was specifically anticipated to the very day by Gabriel some five centuries earlier.  

Jesus warned them of its coming. That's in Luke 19 and it amplified in Luke 21. He told him specifically that this generation would not pass. And 38 years later, the same period of time of the generation in the wilderness, 38 years later on 70 Ad.  

It was destroyed. And over a million and a half men, women and children were slaughtered by the Romans in that dreadful siege. The Christians that followed Jesus instruction. Had retreated by his instruction to Pella over in Peptraya.  

And according to Cebius, the recording, in the third century, not one Christian was killed out of that million and a half that were slaughtered because they followed instructions. Okay, well, now we're going to approach the end of chapter ten, but we're going to be dealing with the fourth of five of these warnings we've been talking about.  

The intensity of each warning gets more serious. This one is about willful sin. It speaks of fiery judgment and sore punishment. The language is getting tougher and tougher. The reference here, the context, is the writer's allusion to end time events.  

Understand that. What's the next thing we're looking for? The harpazo rapture, as it's called. Right. What's the next thing that happens after the rapture? Judgment? Seat of Christ. And that is really in the forefront of what's in the mind of the writer here.  

These subjects have been in his forefront from the beginning of his epistle all the way through, and the author includes himself when he speaks of we in all of these things. He says, if we sin willfully, after that, we have received the knowledge of the truth.  

There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. Wow. The naive reader out of context, that sounds you like you can lose your salvation. That's not what the subject's all about. Four, because of what he just said, if you will.  

He's anticipating the apostasy that was just warned of. Okay, if we sin willfully, that's a conditional circumstantial participle in the present tense. It means continuing action. It's actually the willfully is in front in the Greek, which is a way of making even more intense.  

He's not dealing with one simple, isolated act of sin, but what he's talking about here is a specific sin that is habitually, deliberately committed is the thought here. He's abiding in that sin, if you will.  

It's not a sin committed out of ignorance or weakness. It's a sin planned out, determined and committed with forethought. That's what the Greek emphasizes. Are we together so far? Heavy stuff coming down.  

Hang on. Fasten your seatbelts. The context of this is turning away from knowledge. The specific sin he has in mind is the attempt of his readers to leave Christianity and return to Judaism. That's a repudiation of Christ's sacrifice.  

If we sin, Willfully, after that, we've received the knowledge of the truth. The word there is the readers already have the knowledge, and the knowledge is epignosis, which is precise and correct knowledge, not just an approximation.  

It's very precise. That's an intensive in the Greek, a knowledge of the specific truth. There remaineth no more sacrifice for sins. See, after the readers have read this letter, they will have full knowledge of the truth.  

That's why he's hammering this stuff away so thoroughly. They'll have the truth. The issues involved, the circumstances involved, and the results of their actions will be expressly nailed out here. If they insist upon going back to Judaism, willfully after reading this letter, it will demonstrate the enormity and severity of their defection.  

Wow. That's called apostasy. There'll be no more. If you disparage and put to naught the sacrifice of Christ, there's nothing that will be better or bigger or that will avail you're abandoning the one thing that's been done for you since Jesus was rejected.  

They have no other sacrifice. His was their final. There is. You need to understand the Old Testament perspective here. There are no sacrifices for certain sins. All kinds of sins, had all kinds of special sacrifice.  

This had that one, this had that one. There's one group of sins that had no sacrifices for them adultery, murder and blasphemy. What was the penalty for that? No sacrifice. Death. Death. There was no sacrifice for that, see?  

And there's no sacrifice that can avail if you reject the one that's been made for you. See, for these kinds of sins, the people could not offer a sacrifice. And let me, I'll show you that in Numbers 15 them instead, they were subject to the pain of we're talking physical death here.  

We're not talking loss of salvation. Don't get confused here. Many people do. Numbers 15, starting verse 29, Old Testament Torah Numbers 2015 ye shall have one law for him, that sinneth through ignorance, both for him, and that is born among the children of Israel, and for the stranger that sojournereth among them.  

But the soul that doeth aught presumptuously, whether he be born in the land or a stranger, the same reproaches the Lord, and that soul shall be cut off from among his people because he hath despised the word of the Lord and hath broken his commandment, that soul shall be utterly cut off.  

His iniquity shall be upon him. No sacrifice for those guys. Okay, so when you compare verses 23 and 22 through 25 and verse 26 through 29, the sin that the guy is talking about here involves separating themselves from the others believers permanently.  

They're going to go off back to Judaism, leave the believers. They're going to do that at a huge cost to themselves. And this, as I say, refers to the return to Judaism, the temple and all that entails.  

Why would they do that? Escape the persecution they're experiencing? Because they become Christians. Now, what's even worse about this move on their part that their sin involves a denunciation of the three elements of verse 29 that includes the work of the Son, the work of the Father, and the work of the Holy Spirit.  

All three are involved in those three things. So it's a repudiation of the whole Trinity, and that's bad stuff. For this kind of sin, there is no further sacrifice. The individual is therefore subject to judgment, and it's physical, not spiritual.  

The nature of the judgment in this context means three things. It means physical death. Verse 28 and 29 apply that. It means physical death in the 70 Ad. Judgment. The people that did that were wiped out in the 70 Djgment.  

So that was a fulfillment of that prophecy. It also means spiritually, the loss of rewards in the next life. Now, there's a difference between loss of justification, which you can't do, and loss of your rewards, which you can do, okay?  

And so the background is that for some sins, there was no sacrifice. So for the believer, all sins are forgivable for eternity, but not all sins can be rectified in this life, okay? For if we sin Paul Pass, if we sin willfully after that we have received the knowledge of truth.  

There may be no more sacrifice for sins, but a certain fearful looking for of judgment and fiery indignation which shall devour the adversaries fearful looking for judgment. There's no extra sacrifices for apostasy.  

And it's pretty heavy stuff here. There will be a physical judgment of exactly that kind that came in 70 Ad. When the city and the temple were both destroyed, putting an end to the Levitical system. And the author goes on here he that despised Moses Law died without mercy under two or three witnesses.  

And with what kind of judgment was that man judged at the mouth of two or three witnesses? Death. Actually, he was judged with physical death, didn't lose his salvation or whatever. It was physical death that was an issue.  

The two, three witnesses and all the three previous warnings. So also in the fourth warning, the issue is physical death. Now, those who turn their backs on the one greater than Moses will also suffer physical death in 70 Ad.  

That's his point. Of how much sorrow judgment suppose ye, shall ye be thought worthy? Who hath trodden underfoot the Son of God hath counted the blood of the covenant OOH, and wherewith he was sanctified an unholy thing, and hath done despite unto the spirit of grace.  

If these Jewish believers go back to Judaism, it is rejection of the work of the Trinity. That's the point. There's flagrant contempt for the word of God there's counting the blood of the covenant as the father thing is unholy assault of insolence against the Holy Spirit.  

It's interesting to see what Peter talks about here. Two. Peter two. For it had been better for them not to have known the way of righteousness they and after they have known it, to turn from the holy commandment delivered unto them.  

Boy bad news. Continuing hebrews for we know that you know him that hath said, vengeance belongeth to me, I will recompense, saith the Lord. And again the Lord shall judge his people. And again it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God.  

These are two quotes from Deuteronomy by the writer. They're not the same thing. They're very similar, but not quite the same thing. God's character is at issue here. Vengeance is his sole prerogative.  

Nobody else's. Okay? But he will judge his people. Two different points in these two things. This is a quote from Deuteronomy 32, verse 35, and a quote from the adjacent verse 36. But we learned some things the way this is quoted.  

By the way, there's some fingerprints here I have to share with you before we get to the substance of it. These two quotes are from Deuteronomy 32 35 and 36. Verse 36 is quoted exactly from the Hebrew, okay?  

However, verse 35, it's not quoted exactly from the Hebrew nor from the Greek Septuagint. Not a big deal. But curious, this particular quote happens to be from neither the author is using his own rendering of the text.  

Now, this is not a really big deal, except. That this occurs only in one other place in the Bible, and that's in Romans 1219. It's an idiosyncrasy of guess who? Paul. I submit it as just another of these what I'll call a fingerprint.  

The author of Romans quotes the same as the writer of Hebrews quotes it. It's one of these suggestive evidences that's Paul's fingerprint on the text because he has this particular way of rendering that particular verse.  

He's the only one that does that. It's the only place that this shows up. So I think that's curious. I couldn't pass it by. Let's go on. I want to draw on a pivotal insight from two corinthians five, and I got both the front end back end verses here.  

So you get the context wherefore we labor that whether present or absent, we may be accepted of him. For we must all that mean most of us. I think the word all means what it says, right? For we must all appear before the judgment seat of Christ in the Greek called the bema seat.  

And don't let people tell you that's just a place for athletic awards, I've been taught. You hear that all over the place. It's true that everything here is in the positive sense, but the bema seat is the same seat that Pilate judged Christ, Agrippa, etc.  

It is a judgment seat. This thing about making the bema is misunderstood judgment seat of Christ. Now, everyone, before that judgment seat is saved, that's not the issue. But there are some mysterious issues here that everyone may receive the things done in his body.  

Christ's body? No, the believer's body, according to that he hath done, whether it be good or dead. Who's he talking about? You and me. Knowing, therefore, the terror of the Lord. We persuade men, but we are made manifest unto God and I trust, also are made manifest in your consciousness.  

And he goes on, the point is, we all are going to appear before the judgment seat of Christ. This is the key verse. Second corinthians five nine. You want to make note of this and understand it and take it.  

We all looking forward to the harpats of the rapture, right? What happens after the rapture? You want to find out the details, you can check Nan's book, but let me show you quickly what is on the earth.  

We've studied that again and again. There's the world leader comes up. There's the Great Tribulation. There's the Campaign of Armageddon. That's on the earth, right? What's going on in heaven at this time, prior to all of this?  

There's the rapture in heaven. The first thing we're confronted with, the judgment seat of Christ, the bema seat, as it's sometimes called. We have the Marriage of the Lamb and then we have him return to the earth to set up his kingdom, the Second Coming in its proper term.  

And he establishes the Davidic kingdom, fulfilling the Davidic covenant on the Earth. That's the pattern diagrammed another way. We have the interval of Daniel 70 weeks that we're in now, the last seven weeks to tick off forthcoming prior to that week even starting, the harpazo or the rapture takes place by some distance.  

It could be an hour, it could be 30 years. We have no idea. It's not necessarily contemporaneous with the beginning of 7th week. Many people make that mistake. Then in heaven, we have a series of things.  

We have the beam of seat of Christ and we have the Marriage of the Lamb right down on the earth. We have the familiar abomination of desolation, splitting that 70 week into two halves each halve called three and a half years, 42 months, twelve months.  

It's the most documented period of time in both the Old and New Testament. And it's, of course, climaxed. The Great Tribulation is the last half of that, by the way. It's not seven years, three and a half years.  

Then we have the battle of climate. It builds up the battle of Armageddon, which is interrupted by the Second Coming of Jesus Christ, in which he sets up his kingdom on the earth. We have two mysterious periods of time, whether there's a sheep of goat judgment and the Married Supper of the Lamb.  

And we have this strange 1290 days, 335 days thing in Daniel Twelve that everybody has speculations about. We'll wait and see. But we have the sheep and goat judgments. The more you study that, the more questions it raises.  

Marriage supper. Don't confuse that with the marriage of a Lamb. One's in heaven, one's on the earth, apparently and the great white throne climax at the end of a thousand years and that's what ends it for everybody.  

Then there's a new heavens and new earth and we have this peculiar new Jerusalem come down and hover the earth, whatever all that's about. So that's a quick perspective. We'll talk more about that as we have time before we conclude the session.  

The point is, the bema seat is the judgment that's hanging over leaders of this epistle. That's why Paul has this strange verse. In one Corinthians nine, verse 27, Paul says, I keep my body and bring it under subjection list by any means.  

When I have preached to others, I myself should be a castaway. You got to be kidding. Paul lived his life in paranoia. Was he afraid of losing his salvation? Absolutely not. He wrote the book on eternal security.  

That's not what he's sweating. What does he mean? He's fearful that he might lose his inheritance. Okay. Peter has a similar thing. For the time is coming that judgment must begin at the house of God.  

And if it first begin at us, what shall the end be of them that obey not the gospel of God? For if the righteous scarcely be saved, where shall the ungodly and sinner appear? That's a good question for the unbeliever.  

I want to also point out to you another thing that relates to all of this. Matthew 25 deals with this with the parable of the ten talents. I won't go through the whole thing. You all know that. The guy that had ten got ten more.  

The guy that had five got five more. And then he gets the guy that just had one. He said the Lord answered and said unto him, thou wicked and sloppy servant, thou knewest that I reap where I sowed not and gather where I have not strawed.  

What the guy did was just hide it safely so it wouldn't get lost. And he returns it and he gets that was a losing strategy. Thou ought to therefore to have put my money to the exchangers and then at my coming I should have received mine own with usury or interest.  

Take therefore the talent from him and give it to him which hath ten talents. So this guy didn't cut it very well. Look what happens. But everyone that hath shall be given, and he shall have abundance but from him that hath not shall be taken away.  

Even that which he hath doesn't make much sense. Until you study this parable carefully and cast ye the unprofitable servant into the outer darkness, there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth. And there's many of us that have presumed over the many years that this is talking about being cast into hell.  

This term, Outer Darkness has been executed so provocatively by J. H. Ladd, Jody Dillo and Erwin Lutzer, Charles Stanley and others. I, like many, were very resistant at first. My wife's Diligence, in chasing down the background here, has convinced me that the surprising view is the correct one.  

This is not talking about hell. This is a saved person that's losing his inheritance. The word is that actually in the Greek means the darkness outside. And unfaithful servants are saved by grace, but are not positively awarded for their unfaithfulness.  

Those in the darkness outside have lost the reward of inheritance in the millennial kingdom to presume that this refers to Hades as an illegitimate connotative transfer. And we'll deal with this in the final chapters.  

I think we're going to finish Hebrews enough to do a recap and get into this in more depth, but I want to highlight that right here all through this epistle. It presumes an understanding of what we're dealing with here.  

But the main writers here are Dillo, Ladd, Lutzer and A. E. Wilson and Charles Stanley and others. But if you want to find out about this, I encourage you to take a look at Nan's new book called The Kingdom, the Power and the Glory because it deals with this.  

Thoroughly. And it doesn't just deal with the exegesis and the exposition. It deals with the practical. So what do you do about all this personally? Let's move on. Hebrews ten, verse 32. But call to remembrance the former days in which after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great flight of afflictions, partly whilst ye were made a gazing stock, both by reproaches and afflictions, and partly whilst ye became named companions of them that were so used.  

He's complimenting his readers because among his readers are people that showed some class in the early part of their work. You want to call to remembrance the former days in the which, after ye were illuminated, ye endured a great flight of affections.  

Call to remembrance former days. And the first deterrent to apostasy is to remember one's early days in the faith you've got somebody considering apostasy, remind them of what it was like in their early days.  

It was real. They'll remember, while you were made a gazing stock, the word in the Greek is the word from which we get the term theater, by the way, okay? Theatrical gazing stock. You were made a gazing stock both by reproaches and afflictions.  

And the word afflictions implies persecutions. And it implies in the Greek, the loss of property. This wasn't casual insults. This was serious persecution these people had endured. So it's understandable why they're looking at the possibility of, enough of all this.  

I'm going back to Judaism. And not only that, partly whilst ye became companions of them that were so used, so okay, for ye had compassion of me and my bonds. Again, it sounds like Paul, doesn't it? And look joyfully the spoiling of your goods, knowing in yourselves that ye have in heaven a better and enduring substance.  

The word compassion, there is. Word sympathy, what comes from it. But the word in the Greek is actually much deeper, a deep inner agony that he's talking about. Okay. Cast not away, therefore your confidence, which hath great recompense of reward.  

For ye have need of patience, that after ye have done the will of God, ye might receive the promise. See, the issue here is not salvation. It's reward all the way through spiritual maturity and nothing to do with salvation.  

Finishing well is the name of the game for yet a little while. And he shall come, will come, and will not know. It's quite conceivable that the writer here was confronting the same problem of delay of the second advent which Paul himself had also encountered in Thessalonica.  

That's why he wrote the first and second letters of thessalonica same kind of growing concern. Now, the just shall live by faith, but if any man draw back, my soul shall have no pleasure in him. Wow.  

Does that phrase sound familiar? Yes, it's the key word to a trilogy. Okay. The just shall live, baby. That's a quote from Habakkuk 24. And who are the just? That's what the book of Romans answers. And it quotes this in Romans verse chapter one, verse 17.  

The just shall live. How? That's what Galatians deals with. And this is thus quoted in Galatians 311. How shall they live by faith. And that's quoted here in Hebrews 1037. But in chapter 1039, it's going to set the stage for going into the rest of this.  

For we are not of them who draw back unto perdition, but of them that believe to the saving of the soul patient endurance, so as not to lose their crowns at the judgment seat. Again, there's nothing in these warnings that talks about salvation.  

They'd lose their physical lives if they mess up here, and their rewards, but not their salvation. In Luke 962, we're reminded by Jesus, he says, no man, having put his hand to the plow and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God.  

When you come to Christ, don't look back. Keep back, keep going. Forward. John 1712, jesus himself speaking to the father. He said, while I was with them in the world, I kept them in thy name. Father, those that thou gavest me I have kept, and none of them is lost but the son of perdition, that the scripture might be fulfilled.  

So if you can lose your salvation, god lose something even more his good name. Okay, I love John ten. I love to conclude this so you don't have any doubts about security. John Ten, verse 28 29. Jesus says, I give unto them eternal life, and they shall never perish, neither shall any man pluck them out of my hand.  

My Father, which gave them me, is greater than all, and no man is able to pluck them out of my father's hand. There are two hands involved, and I love to paraphrase Walter Martin, if you can lose your salvation, I've got a new name for God.  

Butterfingers. Okay, we're the last session, the hall of faith, chapter eleven of Hebrews, one of the most famous chapters in the entire Bible, often called the hall of faith. And it's going to climax the trilogy on habakk two four.  

The just shall live by faith, the just was romans shall live by Galatians, but by faith is of course Hebrews. And the Hebrews passage is pointing to the next chapter, which is your assignment for next time.  

Let's stand for a closing word of prayer. Let's bow our hearts. Father, we thank you that you've gone to such extremes on our behalf, and we do pray through your holy spirit and through your word, we would more fully understand the opportunities that lay before us.  

We thank you, Father, that you've gone to such extremes. And yet, father, we also seek your illumination of what specifically you would have of each of us in these days. We pray, Father, that through your Holy Spirit we might grow in grace and the knowledge of Lord and Savior that we each might be more effective stewards of the opportunities and resources you put at our disposal.  

That we would be more pleasing in your sight, O Lord, our strength, our redeemer, our King, in whose name we do pray. Amen.
