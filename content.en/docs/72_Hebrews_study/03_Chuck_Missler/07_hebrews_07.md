Let's do something radical. Let's bow our hearts for a word of prayer. Well Father, we thank you for who you are, and we thank you that you have brought each of us to this point in time. We pray that your purpose would be accomplished in each of our lives as we face the horizon before us.  

And we thank you Father, for this opportunity to delve into Your word. We pray that your Holy Spirit would just open your word to our hearts and lives that through all this we might behold our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  

We do pray, Father, that you would just help each of us to grow in grace in the knowledge of Him in whose name we do pray. Amen. Well, we're continuing our survey or exploration of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and we're in the 8th Sanction in chapter seven, and most of you recall that the first part of this epistle is really Christology Jesus Christ, the new and better deliverer.  

And the writer contrasts our Messiah with all of the traditional pillars of Judaism, the angels, Moses, Aaron and so forth. Last time we entered this area, how Jesus is a priest better than the Levitical priest, the Aaronic priesthood.  

But chapter five had a problem because it really bridges to chapter six, which includes the third of five warnings. In fact, it's the most troublesome of the five warnings to many. And I won't try to recap all of that here, but we got that in Deduced with our study of chapter five and then we really dealt with it in chapter six, basically highlighting the fact that the issue at stake is not eternal security, as it may look to the naive viewer, but rather the gaining of inheritance.  

All of this keying off of course. Numbers 13 and 14 and Psalm 95, both of which are quoted in depth and dealt with that time. But having finished last time the whole issue of chapter six, we are now entering chapter seven.  

And the focus in chapter seven is going to be a lot easier to deal with than the ones we've dealt with so far in the last several chapters. Let me just acknowledge that we've really been dealing with some very difficult, complex, heavy material and hopefully it's been stimulating you to do serious study in those areas.  

But we're actually going to move now into an area that I think at least is clearer in its description. And that's this whole issue of who is this character called Melchizedek? Because back in chapter six, as it was finishing, one of the final verses was whither the forerunner is for us entered even Jesus.  

He was made a high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. Now, this is a character that shows up in a couple of verses in Genesis 14. And if it wasn't for a single reference to this in Psalm 110, it would probably disappear into oblivion, except we're to discover there's several full chapters in this epistle dealing with this strange character Melchizedek.  

And so by mentioning Melchizedek when we closed chapter six, that was actually an echo of an earlier mention in chapter five. He's been hinted at now twice. We're going to jump in now and get into this.  

And I want to remind you, though, when we were in chapter five, chapter before last. The writer spent a lot of time saying to his readers, you're not ready for this. We talked about the milk and the meat of the word and chastised them for being babes in the word and not ready for the material that's coming.  

And the material he was talking about is what we're now going to get into. And so we should be ready for that. But again, all the way through this epistle from front to back, the primary theme is to encourage the listeners, the readers, to press on to maturity.  

The issue is not salvation, not in the sense of justification. Again and again and again, he puts himself in the same can. Let us, let us, let us, the readers are in the same spiritual condition he's in in the sense of being justified by Jesus Christ 100%, by what he's done.  

But what he's arguing for them to do is go from there on to maturity. And that's what the real theme is here. So now we've had Melchizedek alluded to rather cryptically twice. Now we're going to get into it.  

And that's what this chapter is all about. Chapter seven is really about Melchizedek. So here the writer continues for this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most High God, who met Abraham returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.  

Well, if you are familiar with your Bible, you stumble at that first sentence, because here's a character who's King of Salem and he's also a priest. Now, the Jewish mind isn't used to that because he's been conditioned from the beginning that the kings came from Judah and the priests came Levi, two different tribes and not to cross.  

And there's all kinds of anecdotal examples where a king tried to give offerings or vice versa, and it was havoc, it was havoc. But it makes an illusion. Here this character shows up when Abraham was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him.  

So that is an illusion from Genesis 14. Let's go back to Genesis 14. Just read a few verses to get a perspective here. And in the 14th year came Sherdalamar and the kings that were with him there's. A group of kings and they smote the Repaims and Asteroth Carnaim and the Zimzumims and Ham and the Emims, which shave Kiryathim and the Hori and their mount SEIR.  

I'll give you a chart in a minute to lay this out. Don't worry about it. I can't pronounce it properly. Anyway. Unto El Paran, which is by the wilderness. And they returned and came to Enmishpot, which is Kadesh, and smote all the country of the Amalekites, and also the Amorites that dwelt in Hazez Tamar.  

And there went out the king of Sodom and the king of Gomorrah and the king of ADMA and the king of Zeboim and the king of Bala, the same as Zor. And they joined battle with them in the Vale of Siddim.  

You got five kings. And four kings about to go into battle here with Shardel Amar, the king of Alam, and with Tidal, the king of nations, and Amrafel, king of Shinar. That's the Babylonian thing. And might to be Hammurabi in the minds of some scholars.  

And Ariok. The Kim Elazar four kings with five. So they got their little battle going on, okay? And the veil of Sidom was full of slime pits. And the kings of Sodom and Gomorrah fled and fell there. And they that remained fled to the mountain and they took all the goods.  

In other words, the winners took all the goods of Sodom and Gomorrah and their vittles and went their way. So, okay, it's a battle. There were some winners and some losers, all right? But here's the key line.  

And they took Lot, Abraham's brother's son, who dwelt in Sodom and his goods and started it happened that Lot was living in Sodom. These warring tribes in conquering Sodom made a mistake with retrospect.  

They kidnapped Lot and his family and whatever. Big mistake. Big mistake. The battle of the Nine Kings. You've got shemites amrafel. Ariak Shadalamir, King of Elam. Elam is a predecessor to the Persians, okay.  

And Tadal, king of the nations. All these are shemites? It happens. The other kings were Bera, king of Sodom, bershai, king of Gomorrah, shinab, king of ADMA, shemaber, the king of Sebuim, and king of Balar.  

These are Hamites. Think when you think of Ham, think of Egypt or that part of the geography. Shemites. So they have an ethnic difference here, but Sherdolomer is the big cheese in all of this. The Hamites served him for twelve years.  

They were subservient to them, but by the 13th year, they had enough of all this. So they rebel against Sherdol Amir, and he then puts them all down, and he defeated and spoiled the rebels. So the Hamites were rebelling.  

They got clobbered. And in that getting clobbered, Lot gets the that's a quick snapshot of what we just read, okay, so far. All right. And there came one that escaped and told Abraham the Hebrew for he dwelt in the plain of Mama, the Amorite, the brother Eschal, and the brother inur.  

And these were confederate with Abraham. And when Abraham heard that his brother was taken captive, he armed his trained servants, born in his own house, 318 of them. Let's stop right there. Abraham, some scholars suspect, may have been one of the richest men on the planet Earth at that time.  

He had among his servants 318 trained warriors. These aren't just guys that usually on a plow that were recruited to go fight. These were trained. The context implies they were trained militarily. Anyway, these 318 are going to succeed where the five kings couldn't see the four that won and clobbered him and taken goods.  

They're going to fall to these 318. So these guys, you don't mess with them, right? So they pursued them to Dan, that's way up in the north, okay? And he divided himself against them. He and his servants by night smote them and pursue them to Hobah, which is on the left hand of Damascus.  

And he brought back all the goods and also brought again his brother Lot and his goods and the women also, and the people. So Abraham's gang made it. They clobbered the bad guys. They got all the stuff back.  

So that's the background for a very strange incident. That's the reason we're getting into. This is what happens after verse 16. The king of Sodom went out to meet him after his return from the slaughter of Sher del Lamire and the kings that were with him at the valley of Chevy, which is in the King's Dale, in other words, King of Sodom.  

He was one of the losers that has been helped by Abraham beating off his enemies and bringing his stuff back, and he went out to meet him. But then we get to this strange verse. And Melchizedek, the king of Salem brought forth bread and wine, and he was the priest of the most high God.  

Each piece of that is a mystery we're going to get into a little bit. What do you mean he's a king of Salem? Where is that? Not all scholars agree, but most of them regard that as the site that is today Jerusalem.  

Jerusalem. But he introduces bread and wine in this story. And one of the things I'm leaving as an exercise for you to do is go through your Bible and study bread and wine from the beginning. Joseph in prison, the baker, the wine steward.  

Bread and wine introduced there. Through Melchizedek all the way through to what? Holy Communion and the act of redemption of our Messiah. But we'll move on here. See who's the subject here. Melchizedek was the priest of the Most High God, and he blessed him and said, blessed be Abraham of the Most High God, possessor of heaven and earth.  

Very strange title, by the way, but won't spend time on that one. And blessed be the Most High God which hath delivered thine enemies into thy hand, and he gave him tithes of all. Abraham gave Melchizedek tithes right away.  

What's going on here? Who is a melchizedek. Why is Abraham giving him tithes? There's no Aaronic Priesthood yet. Right. Because after Abraham comes Isaac and Jacob and twelve tribes and Levi, and that's later.  

Right? The melchizedek priesthood. Very, very strange stuff. We're going to have this in three chapters here in Hebrews. Really? Many people regard chapters seven through ten of the Epistle of Hebrews as the heart of the Epistle, and there is no other parallels to this section of scripture anywhere else in the New Testament.  

It's a very special place. It's going to compare two covenants and the mediators of two covenants, and that's why it's going to get very interesting here as we go. Well, the slaughter of kings, abraham's army of 318 rescues lot and so forth.  

Melchizedek, who's a king and a priest, receives Abraham's tithes, administers bread and wine. And you see what the writer is doing here. Do you see a parallel being drawn between Melchizedek and some other guy?  

What's the other? Exactly. Exactly. Because there are only well, there's only two primary kings and priests. Melchizedek and Jesus. And that's going to be highlighted as we look at Psalm 110, which is going to make that point as we go through this and Hebrews five, six and seven to deal with this.  

So he's a king of righteousness. That's what the king of Salem salam king of righteousness, king of Salem is Jerusalem and the priest of the most high God he received tithes. The only mentions of him in the Old Testament is the Genesis passage we just read and Psalm 110, verse four, which we'll read in a minute.  

And this is going to contrast with the priesthood as it is in the mind of a Jew in Judaism. His readers, the readers of this epistle are Jews sometime between Ad 32, Christ's ministry, and the fall of Jerusalem in 70 Ad.  

It's in that 38 year period that these Jews are really upset, not sure what to do that this epistle is aimed at. But see, a Jewish mind separates the priesthood of Levi and the kingship of Judah. So that makes Melchizedek a strange paradox to the Jewish mind.  

And there are these two elements by Melchizedek, bread and wine, which to a New Testament reader immediately suggests the Lord's Supper. But let's move on here down to verse two, we're making progress to whom Abraham gave a 10th part of all, first being an interpretation, the king of righteousness.  

And after that, king of Salem, which is king of peace. See here now in verse two, the writer has actually interpreted those two titles as what they suggest, peace, righteousness and peace. Always in that order, by the way.  

Righteous has to come before peace. And Abraham gave him tithes. That's very strange if you understand how a Jew venerates Abraham. I mean, he's up there. But Abraham is subordinate to Melchizedek somehow and a king of righteousness and then king of peace, that righteousness always comes first, peace.  

Now we get a clue here, by the way, that's going to be important when you get to Joshua. He's going to be conquering the land and his adversary is a king that unites a group against him. That's the king of Jerusalem called Adonai Zdek, Lord of righteousness, but it's a false title.  

He's the adversary of Joshua and he gets eventually beat down. So Zdek means king, means righteousness, and it's a false title, but it's also clearly a Jebusite dynastic name. And we'll come to that in a minute.  

But the Hebrew writer of Epistle goes on, says, speaking of Melchizedek, without father, without mother, without descent, that is, without a genealogy, having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but made like the Son of God, abideth the priest continually.  

This is a verse that many people get confused by. They assume that what this is saying is that Melchizedek is a supernatural person having no beginning and no end. No, that's not he's drawing a parallel, a type, an analogy.  

I'll get to that a little bit. There is no father or mother recorded. That doesn't mean he didn't have one. But in the text there is no father and mother and he doesn't have any genealogy. There's no marking of his beginning nor his end.  

So idiomatically it fits a purpose of regarding him as a type of Christ anticipatory model, if you will. Anticipatory model doesn't mean it's the same thing. It's just suggestive of, in other words, and made like the Son of God.  

And Melchizedek, it would seem, is a king forever because it's never mentioned where the ends is the point. So there's no genealogy recorded basically mean it doesn't mean he didn't have parents. It just means they're not recorded.  

They're not relevant to the perspective of the writer here. And he had no predecessor or have no successor, is the idea. There are six similarities at least. Between Melchizedek and the Messiah. Melchizedek was both a priest and a king.  

He was King of Salem. And the last part of his name, Zedek, is a Jebusite. Dynastic name. And Joshua encounters that with Adonai Zedek or the Lord of Righteousness. But he's also a priest. He's a king and a priest, and that makes him distinctive.  

The only other one you find in the Bible like that is Jesus Christ. One one can argue that we are or we have the opportunity to be rule with him and be a king and priest as the 24 elders announce themselves as being in Revelation Five.  

But that's a whole nother thing. His name and title mentions the two things about his reign righteousness and peace. And these two characteristics are also mentioned of the reign of the Messiah. And you all remember this from your Christmas cards.  

Isaiah nine six. For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given, and the government shall be upon his shoulder, and he shall be called wonderful counselor and so forth. Okay, a second similarity.  

The Melchizedekian priesthood issued in blessing in that Melchizedek blessed Abraham. So the fact that both are a source of blessing. Now, how the Messiah's priesthood will be a source of blessing is going to be discussed later in this chapter, so I won't spend time on it.  

Now, third thing, the giving of tithes is a recognition of superiority. You don't give tithes to someone junior, you give tithes to someone senior spiritually. Okay? So Abraham, by tithing to Melchizedek, was acknowledging or recognizing Melchizedek's positional superiority.  

Are we together so far? And it's at this point in verse two that he also the writer explains the meaning of the names. But, see, the fact that Jesus functions as a Melchizedek, Melchizedekian kind of priest shows his superiority over any other priesthood.  

He's going to develop this here with Leviticus. With Levi in a minute. Melchizedek was an independent high priest, as is Jesus. His priesthood was individual in that he appeared on the scene. And all we know about him is that he was a priest of the most High God.  

There's no mention of mother or father genealogy. Genealogy was not relevant to Melchizedek. It's very relevant to the Aaronic priesthood because the way he became a priest, priest under the Levitical system, is you had to be a descendant of Aaron okay?  

And so ancestry was not important from Melchizedek. And that's part of what's going on here. The appointment to Melchizedek's priesthood was independent of human relations, no genealogical requirement.  

That's not true of being a priest in the Levitical system, because unless you could prove that you were a descendant of Aaron, you were disqualified from the priesthood. And there were several times when they returned from Babylon, the Babylon captivity.  

Many claimed to be the office of priesthood, but some could not prove that they had direct descendants of Aaron and were thus disqualified. You had to be a Cohen, a Konanim, which is a descendant of Aaron okay.  

The fourth one, the genealogy, is not important for the Melchizedek priesthood. And by the way, there's no record this is interesting. There's no record of birth or death of Melchizedek. That doesn't mean he wasn't born, didn't die.  

It's not recorded. And that means as a type, that's significant because we're dealing with a model here, an anticipatory type. See, both events occurred. He obviously was born, he died. But the fact there's no record of him allows the Holy Spirit to use this as an exemplar, as an illuminating example of what he's really getting at.  

The Melchizedekian priesthood was timeless. We don't know when it began, when it ended. A Levitical priest served very definitively from the age of 25 to the age of 50 and had to be replaced. And it had a definite beginning and definite end.  

There's no mention of the beginning or end of the. Melchizedek priesthood. And so in that sense, the Holy Spirit's saying Melchizedek was like a model or a type of the Son of God. And because as far as the record of the word of God is Melchizedekian priesthood was timeless and there's no record of it ending.  

Now, the Melchizedekizedekian priesthood was all inclusive that it administered, apparently, to everyone within that region. It wasn't just Jewish. The Levitical priesthood had a limited ministry just to Israel.  

That's another difference. What's, Jesus Christ's ministry just to Israel? No, universally. And Melchizedekian priesthood was universal, so it was Christ. Jesus also has a universal priesthood. Now, because of this background, the writer is using this to make a rhetorical example communicate that's led to speculations that because there's no recorded birth or death, some think if Melchizedek was Shem, shem was still alive then in Abraham's time.  

So is it possible that he was Shem? No, I don't think so, because we know Shem's genealogy that would puncture the model, if you will. Was melchizedek an Old Testament appearance of Jesus Christ. There are many speculators say, well, that was Christ in the Old Testament making appearance because they get confused.  

They're confusing the type with the antitype. Was he a theophony? That is a pre incarnate appearance of Christ? Don't think so, for a lot of reasons. His priesthood what Hebrews points out his priesthood was after the similitude of Melchizedek christ was well, was Melchizedek a celestial being?  

No, he's described as a man in Hebrews 74. So those popular speculations are punctured if you stick with the text. What about this business? The most popular one is somehow it's a pre incarnate Christ.  

The text does not use the adjective that would describe Melchizedek and his being in essence, to be like the Son of God. Instead, it uses a participle meaning that Jesus was similar to Melchizedek only in the likeness of the biblical statement.  

In other words, the grammar would suggest otherwise. The word for being made in the Greek is to cause a model to pass off an image or shaped like it, to express itself in it, to copy, to produce a facsimile.  

We shouldn't confuse the facsimile from the real thing is what the grammar is indicating. And this term is found only here in the New Testament. Second reason it states that Melchizedek was like the Son of God.  

It does not say that he was the Son of God in the Old Testament. A third reason, the second passage where he is mentioned that's in Psalm 110, verse four, distinguishes Melchizedek from the Messiah that also argues against them being the same.  

One of the prerequisites for the priesthood was that the priest had to be human. A priest had to be a representative of humanity, so it had to be human. So at this point back there in Genesis 14, <b>Christ wasn't qualified because he wasn't born of the Virgin yet to be human</b>.  

You with me? So he may appear occasionally, Old Testament in what they call a theophony, but that's not melchizedek was not one of those. Jesus did not become a man until incarnation, where he was conceived by the Holy Spirit in the womb of Mary.  

So before that time, he appeared in the form of man, but was not an actual man. It's an important point. Just as it's important to understand that Christ was God, you also need to understand Christ was man in the early Church.  

One of the gnostic heresies was that, well, he wasn't really a man. No, no. Both attributes of Christ are essential, god and man together. It's going to be very important to us, especially as we get further in this chapter.  

Him. Fifth reason that the Melchizedek could not have been a theophony is that theophanies appeared and disappeared. They held no long term office. All through the Old Testament, there's an appearance like a man, and they call those Theophanes, but they come and they go.  

They don't hold office and assume those kinds of responsibilities. The Melchizedek of Genesis 14 was a king of a city state of Jerusalem, which required a position and a permanent residency. Theophanies never held a position.  

They were always short and temporary for ad hoc manifestations. Okay, so we know that Melchizedek was a living, historic personage. Now, he wasn't an origin, thought one of the great theologians in the early centuries.  

He was not an angel. Some of the Jews said he was Shem, the son of Noah. He was probably Shemitic, but not Canaanite origin, the last independent representative of the original Shemitic population, which had been vanquished by the Canaanites Ham's descendants.  

So the greatness of Abraham, then of Melchizedek, the highest and last representative of the Noah covenant as Christ was the highest, never enduring representative of the Abrahamic. Okay, that's background we don't really need here, I guess.  

Let's keep moving. The Holy Spirit is using as a way of communicating all this as a way of communicating about Jesus Christ in Psalm 110, verse four, and we'll see that quoted here in a minute, that Jesus Christ would be after the order of Melchizedek, not Aaron, and that his reign would be forever.  

Christ could not be after Aaron because he wasn't of the tribe of Levi. For one thing, Jesus Christ supersedes. The key point of this whole thing is that Christ supersedes the Aaronic priesthood, which means that he also supersedes the law.  

And that's an issue that to this day troubles and clouds many that are in the messianic movement because you get enamored with the whole Jewishness of it all. And it's fascinating, but you want to be careful.  

Go back under the law. That's what this epistle is all about. Beginning of days or end of life. You see that Levitical priesthood had a limit Melchizedek did not have. And Jesus will reign forever. Melchizedek is definitely a type, a hint or a model, a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ.  

That's the way the Holy Spirit's using that piece of history. And that's all derivative from hosea 1210, where God says, I have also spoken by the prophets. I have multiplied visions. I have used similitudes.  

And under that you can call them allegories analogies. There are over 200 figures of speech used in the Scripture, and they're cataloged, indexed for you in some of our materials. I have used similitudes by the ministry of the prophets.  

So the Holy Spirit in the text does indulge in similitudes, and he also indulges in puns, deliberate, quantitative transfers and what have you. There's another thing that I just thought I'd insert here that I think is kind of fascinating.  

All through the Old Testament, you find brides used as a type of the church. Adam had eve. He loved her, and because he loved her so much, he in effect, gave himself for her that through that offspring came the redemption.  

Isaac had rebecca. And Melazer goes to get a bride for Isaac. He takes ten camels. And there's a whole parallelism there. It's worth studying. Joseph had asenath. Moses had zippered. Salmon had rehab.  

Rehab was the harlot that helped the spies at Jericho. She is the mother of whom anyone good for you. And Boaz has Ruth. Remember, he takes a Gentile bride. Here are six examples of a Gentile bride as a type, if you will, of the church, or can be considered that way.  

What's fascinating about this observation is none of these. Have their death recorded. I'm not saying they didn't die, but their death's not recorded. Why isn't it recorded? Well, perhaps it's not recorded because that would puncture the type.  

Because what's the 7th one? The 7th Bridegroom is Christ. The 7th bride is the Church. And it doesn't face death. So the model, what I'm going to suggest, see, to the Greek mind, that's most of us, prophecy is prediction and fulfillment.  

Prediction and fulfillment. Prediction, fulfillment. To the Hebrew mind, prophecy is pattern. The Hebrew scholars study patterns because they see in the patterns of the Messiah, they see the history of Israel and vice versa and so on.  

So it's interesting that in the Old Testament, these patterns, it's amazing to me how carefully the Holy Spirit shepherds the patterns. When you have Abram offering Isaac, it's fascinating. Abram offers Isaac, and 2000 years later, on that very spot, another father offers his son.  

What's interesting when you study Genesis 22, when you get to Genesis 24 again, abraham sends his servant Eliezer to get a bride for Isaac, right? And it's interesting when you go back to Genesis 22 and after the offering of Isaac, the Ram is substituted.  

It says Abraham went down the two young men and the three of them, Abraham, the two young men went back home. Three day journey, where's Isaac, he's obviously went went home. But that's not what it says.  

Abraham and the two young men went home. And you discover, when you examine it, Isaac, the person of Isaac, is edited out of the record until he's united with his bride two chapters later. So the Holy Spirit's even superintending the subtleties of the text.  

So it fits the model. So I think that kind of thing is fascinating. Anyways. Move on. Now consider how great this man was, unto whom even the Patriarch Abraham gave the temples. You need to understand how the Jewish mind venerates Abraham.  

And here's a guy. That Abraham, the patriarch of all. When Matthew does his genealogy as a Jew, he starts with Abraham. Because he's the first Jew in that sense. Right. Well, even Abraham gives a spouse to even patriarch Abraham.  

And this is to emphasize that there were priesthoods greater than Aaron's before Aaron even existed. See, the writer is trying to get the Jewish mind to recognize that there are boundaries and limitations to Judaism because the readers of this epistle have been freed from those boundaries.  

They don't go back to them. There were other priesthoods, by the way, hinted at in the scriptures. In Genesis 28, we find Jacob at Bethel giving tithes. Doesn't say to whom. Who are they giving tithe?  

We don't know. Doesn't Say. But there's obviously a priesthood receiving Tithes from Jacob. This is long before Aaron and all that. When Moses is in Midian, who's his father in law? Jethro. Jethro twice is mentioned as what?  

The priest of Midian. Well, that's interesting. What priesthood is that? Don't Know. It just hangs out there. Anyway, let's move on. And verily. They that are the sons of Levi, who receive the office of the priesthood, have a commandment to take ties of the people according to the law, that is, of their brethren, though they come out of the loins of Abraham.  

The writer here is going to indulge in a very rabbinic kind of logic. Because Abraham gave tithes to Melchizedek. Levi hadn't been born yet. So Levi is viewed as being in the loins of Abraham, and thus Levi is.  

Subordinate to Abraham, and Abraham is subordinate to Melchizedek. That's the argument. It sounds weird at first, because Levi ain't around yet. Yes, he is. He's in the loins of Abraham. So they came out of the loins.  

Levites did. Levi was born to Abraham because he was still in his loins. Genealogically speaking, it goes on. But he whose descent is not counted from them received tithes of Abraham and blessed him that had the promises without all contradiction.  

The less is blessed of the better. So, in other words, Melchizedek is senior to Abraham, and that's a tough thing for a Jewish mind to accept at this point. Here, whose descent is not counted from them.  

Abraham had promises, so that's precious. But it's Melchizedek that blessed Abraham. That makes Abraham's subordinate to Melchizedek. As the lesser always gives ties to the greater, who in turn blesses the lesser.  

And here, men that die receive tithes, but there he receiveth them of whom it is witnessed that he liveth. He that liveth means, of course, Jesus Christ. Men that die receive tithes means Levi, he died, and so did his descendants, who also served that office.  

By the way, this verse also implies that Melchizedek himself personally did die. It's not recorded because that would break the model. But he obviously didn't live forever. That's the point. Okay. As I may say, levi also, who receiveth tithes paid tithes into Abraham, and he was yet in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.  

So that's basically the same thing reiterated. Understand, in the Old and New Testament, the word father can mean grant. It doesn't mean a direct ascendant it can be. Grandfathered can be great grand.  

The same term is used. A grandfather would be called father. A great great great grandmother is a father. We use the term descendant to be ambiguous. So and so descended from so and so. You don't know if it was immediate or ten generations later.  

Do you follow me? Well, it works the other way, too. The language. Doesn't have a word for they don't have the word like we have in English, grandfather, so forth. There's no exact word. So the word father does not mean a direct son, but simply a predecessor.  

If therefore perfections were by the Levitical Priesthood. So you're going to point out the Levitical Priesthood is imperfect? This is the main thing the writer is going to get across. It's very delicate subject to a Jewish mind.  

If therefore perfection were by the Levitical priesthood, for under it the people received the law, what further need was there that another priest should arise after the Mechizedek and not be called after the order?  

Aaron. In other words, if the Levitical priesthood was adequate, why would there be another one? Why should another priest rise after okay, understand the link between the Levitical priesthood and the law.  

They go together. They go together. And here he's referring. When he says the law, he's referring to the Torah. The Five Books of Moses. He's saying that if perfection were possible by the Levitical priesthood, what further need would there be for a priest after this earlier order, the Order of Melchizedek?  

See, Psalm 110 says promising Christ you're going to be a priest after the order of Melchizedek. Why isn't it under? Aaron because Aaron's imperfect. This one's perfect. That's the whole point. The ironic priesthood is superseded.  

And this is a very delicate subject which runs the risk of offending Jewish believers. He is going to highlight and point out that the Levitical priesthood was imperfect, incomplete and temporary and destined to be superseded.  

It never gave redemption and acceptance before God to the people. And that's exactly what Jesus Christ did. He not only fulfilled, but he also superseded the Levitical priesthood. That's the key point that this writer is approaching somewhat delicately because he's built and it's interesting all the way through here.  

The writer is not arguing from any point of authority. His only authority is the text. His entire case is being built out of the Old Testament because he's dealing with a Jewish mind. Yes, I believe it is, Paul, but he's not writing an apostle authoritatively.  

He's leading them to understand what their own scriptures that they already accept imply. That's a key point for the priesthood being changed. There is made, of necessity, a change also of the law. Law?  

Wow. The Torah. Strange. See, the Mosaic Law belonged to the ironic priesthood where they offered bloody sacrifices. The Mosaic law and the Aaronic Priesthood go together. They're linked. We are not under the Mosaic law.  

That's a tough thing for many people to swallow. For he of whom these things are spoken, pertaining to another tribe of which no man gave attendance at the altar. And what is he talking about? Levi was the only tribe that represented the people before the altar of God.  

Kings and priests were separate under the Levitical tribal system. Melchizedek was not of any specific tribe, and from this point of view, neither is Christ, except he's from the tribe of Judah. Of course, he of whom these things are spoken refers to Jesus Christ.  

He was the tribe of Judah, the royal line. And of course, to the Jewish mind, that's a contradiction. Royal versus priesthood, they're always supposed to be separate in the Jewish mind. That's what he's trying to get crawl over here.  

For it is evident that our Lord sprang out of Judah, of which tribe Moses spake nothing concerning the priesthood. The ironic priesthood was required and in Numbers 16 and 17, that's all dealt with. Descendant of Aaron would serve from age 25 to 55, and then he's replaced, and many were disqualified for lack of proof when he got back from Babylon.  

And Ezra two, and Nehemiah seven. That is a big issue, for it is yet more evident that after the similitude of Melchizedek, there arises another priest. Not Melchizedek, but one modeled after that, if you will, a modeler.  

He's dealing by an analogy. Here and there arises another priest. Now, the word another in the Greek. See, in the English, if somebody says, Give me another pencil, there's something I don't know about that sentence.  

Do I want one exactly the same or one of a different kind? In the Greek, I've got two words. I've got the word heterose or alos. If I use the word alos, that means I want a pencil exactly like the one I just broke.  

If I say heterose, that means I want a different kind. Give me a red one or a green one or something. Follow me. In the Greek, when I ask for another, I can tell from the language whether it's another, the same, or another that's different.  

Give me another one when I say it that way. No, I don't want that one. I want a different kind. I don't want chicken eggs. I want goose eggs or something. Well, here, the word in the Greek is not ambiguous.  

The word is heterose, that it's another of a different kind, not another of the same kind. Okay? There arise another priest, a priest of a different kind. And so this shows that the old priesthood was temporary.  

It was evident by what is spelled out in the preceding verses and is yet far more evident for that after the similitude of Melchizedek arises another priest, who is made not after the law of a carnal commandment, but after the power of an endless life.  

Wow. See, the law is still carnal. It's fleshly, the law. You can't keep it's just there to show you that you can't keep it. That's what the book of Romans is all about. But rather, we're rather after that, rather than a current law of a carnal commandment, we're after the power of an endless life.  

Wow. And this is a way of pointing out that the law of God that God gave after the flesh ordained. The Levitical priesthood and its succession by genealogy are linked together. Old versus the old was based on the law, which was outward.  

The new is based on inward power and is inward. The old system meant that man was a priest only because his father was a priest. Now, if you were born as a descendant of Aaron, you were eligible to be a priest.  

And that resulted in some pretty dismal priests, some some really bad news. And remember, Aaron himself made a golden calf when pressured, right? And of course, Eli's sons, they were priests, but they were full of gluttony and immorality and what have you.  

One Samuel, two, and so on. Now, this one had been made the Greek perfect tense emphasized the abiding nature. He has been made a priest and continues, he has been and forever will be is the point is the thought.  

In the case of Jesus, the basis was according to the power of an endless life. Jesus became a priest after his resurrection, and by virtue of his resurrection, he lives forever, so he's never to be replaced, in contrast to Aaron and the writer suggesting that's all modeled in a sense, from Melchizedek.  

For thou art a priest forever after the order of Melchizedek. That's quoting Psalm 110, verse four, emphasizing two things the eternality of the priesthood you're a priest forever, it never stops. And also the character of the priesthood after the order of Melchizedek.  

And so this was a prophecy given under Mosaic Law because it's part of the Old Testament. It's part of the thing. For there is verily, a disanulling of the commandment going before, for the weakness and profitableness thereof.  

This verse, verse 18, is a toughie in terms of the Jewish mind. Disanulling. There is verily, a disanulling of the commandment going before. The word disanulling in the Greek thesis, means to abolish.  

The only other place it appears is in Hebrews Nine, verse 26, where it talks about putting away sin forever. Abolishing in. There's a very strong term there's verily, a disanulling of what the commandment going before Christ's death put away the law for two reasons disallowed the law because the weakness.  

The Law could not impart strength or justification. The law cannot impart strength nor justification. That's what the book of Romans is all about. The second thing is the unprofitableness thereof. The Law could not impart life.  

The best you could do is show you where you fail, not how to succeed. Thus, the priesthood that is after the Law can only be temporary. It's destined, therefore, to be replaced, to be superseded. And that superseding of it is what we have in hand with Jesus Christ as our high priest.  

The law has been disanulled. Boy, that's a heavy topic. But this is a clear statement in the text that the Law has been put away. This was essential for Jesus to function in his new priesthood. If the Law were still in effect, he could not be a priest.  

He could be a priest only because the Law has been put away, because he wasn't from the tribe of Levi, <b>he wasn't qualified</b>. You follow me? He is again making the point that the Law itself didn't perfect anything.  

It simply shows us the need for a savior. And that's what Romans five, six and seven is all about. For the Law made nothing perfect, but the bringing in of a better hope did by the which we draw nigh unto God.  

That's the goal. The law didn't bring you to God. It showed you the need for a savior. The Law of Moses is a terrifying picture of a God that requires righteousness. As you study your Bible and understand God, and you understand he's a righteous God, that's important to understand his perfection.  

But it's scary if you really understand it, it does not draw you to the holy God. And by the way, what drew Moses was a burning bush that was not consumed. The bush was a thorn bush of the desert, a symptom of sin.  

But it was burning but not consumed that fascinated him. So he went up there to find out what was about. It's a model of grace, being judged but not consumed. It's always grace that attracts, not righteousness.  

You need to know the righteousness there, but what attracts you is his grace. It does not draw you near to or nigh to a holy God. Only God can fulfill the Law and provide you with the righteousness which allows you to be in the presence of a holy God.  

Nothing less than the death of God Himself availed to pay the price to allow you access and presence to Him. Jesus indeed, contrary to our neuronic priest, he draws us near to God. Through his love we draw near, and by his righteousness we can be near God.  

Okay, inasmuch as not without an oath he was made a priest. The were made without an oath, but this with an oath by Him that said unto him thou, Lord, swear and will not repent. Thou art a priest forever.  

After the order of Melchizedek, a Levitical priest became a priest by genealogy. Period. There was no oath involved. From Melchizedek, as testified in Psalm 110, verse four, god swore. And will not repent.  

Thou art a priest forever after. So he is done by an oath of God, which means there's no repentance, no changing God. Lord swear and will not repent, will not change his mind. The Levitical priesthood was not set up with an oath that was genealogical.  

The Melchizedek priesthood was unique in that it was by divine oath, as Psalm 110 four nails it down, and those things that are sworn become permanent and unchangeable. That's a common thread throughout this epistle that explains the enigma of Hebrew six and the impossibility of repentance there.  

And it continues to be a thread here. By so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. Okay, the word surety, there is a principle I think you've heard me allude to, that people call the law first mention we discover by studying the Bible.  

The first time a concept emerges is usually very significant. The word surety, what does that mean? It's like a bondsman, a sponsor, someone who gives himself as. Security is what assurity is here. The Law first mentioned this concept of surety first emerges when Judah proposed that he may be made a surety for the return of his brothers.  

Remember in Genesis 43? And Judah proposes that he's a surety. That's where the term first comes up, like a security deposit. The tribe which is thus represented here is Judah. Our security, yours and mine, is in the lion of the tribe of Judah because he's standing in our stead.  

And this is not a coincidence. Every detail in the Scripture I maintain is there by design. The fact that sure first emerges, the concept happens to be tied to the tribe of Judah because that's the critical surety for you and I.  

The same concept of surety. You can also see in Paul's Epistle to Philemon about onesimus, the no way slave and all of that, where Paul offers to be a surety for him. The covenant with Adam did not have a surety, but the covenant with Israel did.  

Big difference by so much was Jesus made a surety of a better testament. Same verse, but let's focus on this word testament. Dathotake is a covenant sometimes rendered testament. The covenant is probably the better term in some respects, but testament implies it's unilateral because usually a last will, the beneficiary doesn't participate.  

It's a one way thing, but in that sense it's a testament. But the word covenant captures the commitment probably a little more clearly. This is the first total of 17 times that this word is used in this epistle alone.  

So it's an important word. It's used a total of 33 times in the entire New Testament and of course, half of them here in this epistle, the security of the new covenant. We're going to talk more about that in the next session.  

Is Jesus Christ himself. He ministers in a superior sanctuary by a better covenant and built upon better promises. And that's a summary of Hebrews eight, nine and ten that we'll see coming along here.  

And they truly were many priests because they were not suffered to continue by reason of death. But this man, because he continues forever, hath an unchangeable priesthood. See, a Levitical priest could only he's going to die, first of all.  

In fact, he was out of business at 50, but even so, he would die. He had to be replaced. This man, because he lives forever, will never be changed. It's an unchangeable priesthood. And so the others mortal and died.  

They had to be continually replaced as unchangeable, which the very specific Greek word means does not pass from one to another. In that sense, ironic versus melchizedek. What's the difference between Aaron and this is a summary slide.  

It's law versus power. The law restrains power, enables it's. An external commandment versus life, internal carnal flesh versus endless eternal life. Changing versus unchanging, weakness and unprofitableness versus being near to God.  

One is nothing is completed or perfected versus one that gives us a better hope. That's a quick contrast between the two. Now this is a key verse, some would argue the key verse of the chapter for sure.  

Wherefore he who's the he Jesus, where for he is able also to save them to the uttermost that come unto God by Him seeing he ever liveth to make intercession for them. One of the most exciting facts you need to be conscious of moment by moment, day by day, is that while we sit here, jesus'full time job is to be praying for you before the Father.  

Wow. That's access that's prayer power in its ultimate. And when it says save to the uttermost, it doesn't mean he's going to save everybody. No, the ones he's praying for, he's praying for everything for them.  

The uttermost is to the one he's praying for. The word is completely, perfectly, utterly save them to the uttermost. These words intend to exclude nothing. There is no condition or situation that you may be facing that is not included in his prayer life.  

Wow. I don't think we have any concept of how important that is in our day to day walk. How often he's praying for you, for needs you didn't even know you had. Wow. Uttermost that come unto God by him.  

And this is the only condition. See that uttermost isn't for everybody, it's for that come to God by Him. That's the condition that they come unto God by Jesus. That's pretty narrow point of view. Yes, it is.  

But that is what the scripture says all through it. There's no other name given among men by which you should be saved. He said, I am the truth, the way, the life. No man cometh on the Father but by me.  

Those are his explanations. Now he's able to bring them to God by making intercession for them. And that's amplified in Romans five and one John, one elsewhere ever liveth to make that's his purpose in life, the basis of our eternal security is that he can save forever because his priesthood is forever.  

Boy, that's breathtaking. That's breathtaking for such a high priest became us who is holy, harmless, undefiled, separate from sinners and made higher than the heavens. Wow, that's a mouthful spotless.  

Priest he's holy. That's his personal purity. He's not capable of sinning. His relationship is Godward. Could christ sin? Absolutely not. He's incapable of it. He is guileless. He's without evil in his thought life.  

He was innocent and harmless in his relationship. Manward the first one is Godward. That's the holiness. Second one, he's guileless. That's manward. This one is undefiled. He's unstained. His relationship is sinward and refers to his moral purity in contrast to the ritual purity of the Levitical priests, which were rituals only, though this is real substance.  

He's separate from sinners, and he's made higher than the heavens. That's what's all embodied in the priest that you and I have the benefit of. Boy, what a priest we have who needh not daily as those high priests to offer up sacrifice first for their own sins and then for the peoples.  

For he did this once when he offered up himself. See, the Levitical priests, when they were on, the first thing they had to do was put up a sacrifice for themselves to get cleansed ritually. Then they could offer sacrifice for others.  

That was the procedure, which is a ritual, not Christ, because he offered himself personally once and for all. And for that reason, that ends it. This he did once. Very important concept. Now the sequence.  

One of the tasks that a liturgical priest was to offer sacrifices, they first did for themselves. So they were ritually cleansed, and then then they could represent the people and so forth. There were men sinners still in the need of sacrifice for their sins.  

They were still sinners. These priests were. The writer is contrasting the liturgical priest with a high priest who didn't have to offer a sacrifice for himself. Why? Because he's free from sin. And in fact, he offered himself.  

That was the offering on the cross for us. Now he's able to provide for us this very moment because where is he right now, by the way? He's sitting at the right hand of the father, right. Do you realize that in the tabernacle there were no chairs?  

The priests never sat. They were always standing. Okay. And there were seven pieces of furniture in the tabernacle. We'll study in another session or two, but there were no chairs, no place to sit on it.  

They tried. They were always working. He is sitting where? On his father's throne. I think that's pretty good access, right. For the law maketh the men high priests which have infirmity but the word of the oath which was since the law laketh the son who was consecrated forevermore trying to show that Jesus above and superseded the Leviticus.  

I think you may think he's overkilling this. But if you go through Leviticus eight and nine and read about priests, then come to this, you realize he has superseded all of that. And there to be a priest, they'd be born into it.  

And even in its own way, the ironic priesthood points to Jesus. Even though he wasn't system, it still points to priesthood in another sense. And see, the concept of genealogy had to be an heir to be a priest, you had to be an ancestor of Aaron.  

But the high priests were washed anointed the concept of water, the word were linked up there in a repetitive washing. You and I are washed in his blood once and for all. Judiciously. But were washed practically daily, continually, by the water of the Word.  

There's two different concepts of washing here. And all the details of the priests were symbolic. They were clothed in white garments. So is Christ in Revelation. They were made a sin offering and took the blood to put on the right ear.  

In other words, what they heard, the right thumb, that is what they did. And the right foot, where they went. That was the ritual with the Levitical priests. They were anointed with sacred oil, the Holy Spirit.  

The oil which was used was incredibly expensive. All that is symbolic of Christ. So even in its own way, the Levitical priesthood is predict. Everything in the Scripture in one way or another is predictive of Jesus Christ.  

The offerings themselves may shock you to realize that the Levitical sacrifice did not start with the law of Moses. We always assume they did because they were ceremonialized under the law of Moses in the Torah.  

Remember that when Abram was told to offer Isaac in Genesis 22, the ultimate Akida, that was before the book of Exodus. That's in Genesis 22. Even the story of Cain and Abel is really about sacrifices.  

But it really all starts back in Genesis three when Adam and Eve tried to cover themselves with coats of skin, god covered them, teaching them that by the shedding of innocent blood they'd be covered.  

That concept, that redemptive concept, is introduced in verse 21 of chapter three. And of course, echoes all the way through, long before the law of Moses. See, the animal sacrifices that populate all these rituals don't really pay for sin.  

They are a model or a foreshadowing of Jesus Christ, the only one that could pay for sin. There are a lot of different offerings burn offering, meal offering. I won't go through all those details. Now, I encourage you to study them out.  

There's also a sin offering and a trespass. How do these things differ? Well, the first three are voluntary a sweet Savor. They're offerings to God. The last two are non sweet. Savers that's for us, for our sin, our trespasses.  

See, the other ones are celebrating what God has done. The last two are pointing to our need for redemption. And the burnt offering had a special name and it points to Christ, which God makes his soul, an offering for our sin.  

This is followed by a meat offering, really. It's an unusual, unfortunate old English term to call it meat. It really means strong food. They were really grain. The meat offerings were grain, actually, and an ablation of form.  

They were a form of thanksgiving. Peace offering was also like a banquet or celebration kind of thing. The sin trespass offerings were specific, of course. The most strangest one is the Passover, which is a non Levitical, because the high priest didn't do it, the head of the family did.  

So it's an interesting one to study for a lot of other reasons, all pointing to Christ, by the way. But in fact, Passover season is all about that. So the liturgical priests were taken upon men. They were publicly official, they gave gifts and sacrifices before the throne.  

They were not exempt from their own infirmities, they were not self appointed. They were chosen and proved by God. Christ is our high priest. He's one of the exceptional circumstances. There's a Son of God, not just as a son of man, he's without sin unique in that aspect.  

And his order being after the order melchizedek is higher than that of the Levitical order, bar none. And so he had the most solemn form of ordination possible. The oath of God himself is recorded in Psalm 110.  

So the excellency of a sacrifice he offered himself isn't any bigger sacrifice than that. Every dimension of the priesthood, he is the ultimate expression of the perfection of his administration. He accomplished what others could just hint at his off perpetual.  

It isn't transferable and it will never expire. Praise God. That's an introduction. What I want you to do for next time is to review chapter eight, which is going to talk about a better covenant. We have a better priest.  

Let's take a look at the covenant. This is. The New Testament gets its name. The New Testament is the New covenant. What's that all about? It's more than just Jeremiah 31. We'll get into that next time.  

Let's stand for a closing word of prayer. Let's bow our hearts. Father, we thank you that we are the beneficiaries of such a fantastic high priest, and we can only clumsily begin to get a glimpse of the benefits we enjoy in contrast to that which went before.  

We acknowledge, Father, we can learn from the Aaronic priesthood and from the Torah. And yet, Father, we rejoice as we realize that that's all been superseded by our Savior, our redeemer, our high priest.  

And we are just breathless as we realize that his commitment to prayer is continual on our behalf. O Father, we thank you for all of this, acknowledging that we can just begin to get a glimmer of understanding here, that o Father, we thank you.  

We thank You, Father, not only for our creation and our bodies that are so fantastically skillfully designed, but even more for our redemption, that You've gone to such extremes as to provide for our failures, our inability to keep the law, but the law that shows us our need for a redeemer, and how precious that redeemer is.  

Father, we just thank you for him. And we do pray, Father, that through Your Holy Spirit you would continue to reignite in each of us a new hunger, a new appetite for Your word that you would guide us.  

To appropriate these insights to our own lives as we commit ourselves into your hands. Indeed, in the name of yeshua, our High Priest, our Redeemer, our Lord and King in whose name we do pray. Amen.
